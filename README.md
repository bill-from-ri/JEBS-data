# JEBS-data
Annotations, training data, and testing data used in _JEBS: A Fine-grained Biomedical Lexical Simplification Task_, which was accepted to ACL 2025. These annotations are derived from the [PLABA](https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/plaba2024/) dataset. Each `.txt` file in the annotations folder has an accompanying `.ann` file that stores expert terms and their accompanying definitions.
