At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

A large number of people experience misophonia (having a strong reaction to specific sounds).
In 2013, the Amsterdam Study Group recommended criteria, such as signs and symptoms, to diagnose misophonia.
However, misophonia is not yet included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a handbook for health care providers to guide the diagnosis of mental disorders.
This report is the first report on drug use that directly affects misophonia and shows a 14-year old girl with misophonia who is successfully treated with fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac).
The patient's misophonia symptoms had been continuing for approximately 2 years, and her quality of life (a patient's ability to enjoy normal, everyday activities) was significantly reduced.
Fluoxetine 10 mg/day was started and increased to 20 mg/day after a week.
At the second-month follow-up with the patient, because of partial improvement, the fluoxetine dose was increased to 30 mg/day.
At the fourth-month follow-up, there was a 40% decrease in Amsterdam Misophonia Scale score (a rating scale to measure how severe symptoms are) with a 70% decrease in the children's global assessment scale scores (a score that measures overall level of functioning).
By the 16th week, the overall functionality level was good at the end.
In conclusion, fluoxetine may be used as an effective drug in the treatment of misophonia.
