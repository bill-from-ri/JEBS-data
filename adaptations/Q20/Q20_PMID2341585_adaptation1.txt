At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Fluoxetine is a type of antidepressant that is also called prozac. Twenty-five patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder, a type of anxiety with unexpected events of intense fear, who either did or did not have agoraphobia (an intense fear of open spaces or leaving the home) are treated openly with fluoxetine for up to 12 months.
For most patients, treatment is started at 5 mg/day to minimize side effects that is connected with starting the medication at a higher dose.
Nineteen (76%) experienced small to major improvement in panic attacks.
Four (16%) were unable to handle fluoxetine because of side effects.
Starting treatment of panic disorder with low doses of fluoxetine may increase its acceptability and allow more patients to benefit from fluoxetine.
