At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Fluoxetine is a type of antidepressant that is also called prozac.
There is the possibility that fluoxetine can be given to patients in dose amounts that is different from the regular doses of other medications.
In order to study the treatment for major depressive disorder, this study examined how well patients handled a weekly dose of fluoxetine and then monitored the same amount but given daily during a following phase of the study.
In this study, 114 patients first receive treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 7 weeks.
Next, 70 patients are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg fluoxetine daily with 21 subjects, 60 mg fluoxetine weekly with 28 patients, or placebo of an inactive substance that looks like the drug with 21patients and are followed for 7 weeks.
Scores for depression using a rating scale and blood levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, another form of fluoxetine, are analyzed.
Blood levels for both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine differ across the three treatment groups, but there are no major differences in the scores for depression observed.
There is no difference in the rate of patients who dropped out of the study across the groups.
Patients cannot correctly identify the treatment group into which they were assigned.
Weekly dosing of fluoxetine seems to be handled well by patients and is  possibly as effective as daily dosing for treating patients with major depressive disorder.
