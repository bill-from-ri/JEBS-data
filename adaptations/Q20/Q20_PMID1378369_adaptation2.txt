At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increase serotonin, are recent, notable antidepressant drugs.
SSRIs show similar success to other common antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine.
Still, since the studies have small patient samples, no definite statements about the relative antidepressant success of SSRIs can be made.
In these studies, no difference was identified between SSRIs and other antidepressants.
Importantly, SSRIs have differences like effect duration among other antidepressant medications like fluoxetine.
This distinct effect duration may alter the drug's success and should be considered when switching patients' treatments.
Studies with fluvoxamine (an antidepressant SSRI) occured with patients in and out of hospitals, while studies with other SSRIs occured largely with patients out of hospitals.
Using fluvoxamine (an antidepressant drug) may lead to nausea, but this may be due to using high starting doses rather than steadily-increasing dosages for use in early trials.
20 mg of flueoxetine may give a decent antidepressant response and be useful for those with long-lasting, movement-inhibiting depression.
More data is needed to define the success of other antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline and citalopram.
SSRIs like fluvoxamine and fluoxetine seem to help treat a variety of mental illnesses other than depression.
Patients put up with SSRIs better than other non-SSRI antidepressants and without notable side effects, sleepiness, heart damage, or weight gain.
SSRIs can lead to nausea, especially with high starting doses.
However, the frequency of nausea may decrease as treatment continues.
