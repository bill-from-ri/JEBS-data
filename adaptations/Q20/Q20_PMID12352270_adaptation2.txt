At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Those with depression may fall back after temporary improvement and still experience minor symptoms.
This work compares the rate of re-suffering depression and the frequency of depressive symptoms between patients treated with fluoxetine (an antidepressant medication) alone or with thought therapy.
132 patients with temporary improvement from depression after 8 weeks with 20 mg of fluoxetine had the dose increased to 40 mg.
The patients randomly received either cognitive or thought therapy or medication management and were monitored for changes in symptoms or regression for 28 weeks.
47 patients did not complete the 28-week phase.
Rates of non-completion or regression did not differ between groups.
Change in depressive symptoms did not differ between groups.
In this work, cognitive or thought therapy with 40 mg of fluoxetine did not give additional benefit compared to fluoxetine 40 mg alone during the 28 weeks of follow-up.
