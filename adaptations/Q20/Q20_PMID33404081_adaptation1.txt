At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Several analyses using data from multiple studies have found a relationship between the amount of a medicine given (dose) and its effect in a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The objective of this study is to investigate how these SSRI drugs are dosed in doctor's offices and health clinics.
Researchers describe SSRI doses in 50,365 people living in a specific region in Sweden, with a diagnosis of depression and starting SSRI treatment between 2007 and 2016.
The main question is to explain the extent these people are prescribed a daily dose that is expected to get a peak response that would not go higher with a higher dose, which is > 20 mg of citalopram, >10 mg escitalopram, >10 mg fluoxetine, >10 mg paroxetine or >50 mg sertraline - all SSRIs.
Overall, 21,049 (54%) out of 38,868 individuals <65 years of age, and 9,131 (79%) out of 11,497 individuals â‰¥65 years of age, never receive an SSRI dose reported to bring about a maximum antidepressant effect.
These dosing practices are seen for citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline, but not for fluoxetine and paroxetine, and are frequent in both general care and specialized care.
Between 59% and 68% of individuals <65 years of age received the maximum efficacy dose (the dose where an increased dose given would not lead to improvement) for the next prescription. That percent is as frequently as in those prescribed a sub-maximum efficacy dose which is the dose that has a lower response despite an increase in the dose amount.
In conclusion, most patients taking an SSRI to treat their depression never receive the dose that is most likely to effectively fight their condition based on detailed reviews of available data.
The lack of agreement on the effective dose amount of SSRIs may have contributed to this conclusion.
