Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

More than 2 million people in the United States have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This diseases is characterized by immense fatigue, pain, and abnormal sleep.
This study performed metabolomics, or evaluated biological metabolites or energy-regulating molecules, to gain insights into the biology of CFS.
This study evaluated a total of 84 subjects.
Forty-five subjects (22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.
Thirty-nine subjects (18 men and 21 women) were age- and sex-matched normal controls.
Males with CFS were on average 53 (±2.8) years old.
Females were on average 52 (±2.5) years old.
The Karnofsky performance scores (a scoring system to determine ability to perform tasks) were 62 for males and 54 for females.
The study targeted 612 metabolites in plasma (blood) from 63 biochemical pathways.
Patients with CFS showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways.
Eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic, or abnormally low metabolic rate, syndrome.
Pathway abnormalities included several types of dysregulated metabolisms.
High accuracy for diagnosis was found in both males and females using metabolite levels.
The data show that, despite several different factors leading to CFS, the cellular metabolic response in patients was the same, statistically robust, and chemically similar to the environmental stress known as dauer.
