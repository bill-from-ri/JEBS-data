Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Abnormalities of Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) incorporation into phospholipid (fatty molecules that build a cell's wall) are found in chronic diseases.
Changes in circulating EFA metabolites (EFAM) decrease EFAM responsiveness of immune cells, and cellular EFAM production have been associated with disease.
This study hypothesized that changes in EFAM ratio is the normal response to stressors. However, when stressors are excessive or prolonged, EFAM systems may become unresponsive.
Many stable systems become deranged and held in that state by minor stressors.
Literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS - long-lasting tiredness) shows several abnormal biological response related to dysfunctional changes in EFA metabolism.
This study explains chronic immune system activation and hypo-responsive immune function in CFS through EFAMs.
Dietary EFA modulation (DEFA) can alter ratios of both membrane EFAs and produced EFAMs. If maintained, DEFA can restore hypo-responsive function.
This study discusses dietary strategies and relevance in CFS. This study also evaluated a case series of CFS patients applying DEFA with other titrated (concentrated) published managements.
This hypothesis and DEFA may be relevant in other chronic conditions.
