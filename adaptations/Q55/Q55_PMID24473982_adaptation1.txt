Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Loss of function in mitochondria, the key organelle responsible for cellular energy production, can result in the excess fatigue and other symptoms commonly found in chronic diseases.
A reduction in mitochondrial function occurs as a result of several changes. These include: maintenance loss of the transmembrane (trans-cell-boundary electrical) potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane, abnormal function of the electron transport chain, or reduced transport of critical metabolites (energy-regulating molecules) into mitochondria.
These changes result in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (energy creation) and reduced production of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP - the main currency of energy in a cell).
Several components of this system require routine replacement. This system can be assisted with natural supplements.
Clinical trials have shown the utility of using oral (by mouth) replacement supplements.
Combinations of these supplements can reduce the fatigue and other symptoms associated with chronic disease. These supplements can naturally restore mitochondrial function, even in long-term patients with uncontrollable fatigue.
