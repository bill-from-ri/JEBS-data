Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Background: Phosphatidylserine (PS) may have beneficial effects on cognitive functions.
We evaluated the efficacy of a novel preparation of PS containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids attached to its backbone (PS-DHA) in non-demented elderly with memory complaints.
Methods: 157 participants were randomized to receive either PS-DHA or placebo for 15 weeks.
Efficacy measures, assessed at baseline and endpoint, included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Rey Complex Figure Test, and a computerized cognitive battery.
Clinicians' Global Impression of Change was assessed following 7 and 15 weeks of treatment.
Results: 131 participants completed the study although 9 were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to protocol violation.
At endpoint, verbal immediate recall was significantly improved in the PS-DHA group compared to the placebo group.
Post-hoc analysis revealed that a subset of participants with relatively good cognitive performance at baseline had significant treatment-associated improvements in immediate and delayed verbal recall, learning abilities, and time to copy complex figure.
These favorable results were further supported by responder analysis.
Conclusions: The results indicate that PS-DHA may improve cognitive performance in non-demented elderly with memory complaints.
Post-hoc analysis of subgroups suggests that participants with higher baseline cognitive status were most likely to respond to PS-DHA.
The results of this exploratory study should be followed up by additional studies aimed at confirming the present tentative conclusions.
