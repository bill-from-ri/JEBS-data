How can covid cause cell injury?

There is evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a severe breathing-related virus, can infect various body organs, like heart cells.
This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can cause myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and possible treatments.
The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific cell parts to attach to heart cells.
Thus, different blockers of specific cell parts may help with SARS-CoV-2-infected heart cells.
(2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses a specific molecule for replication.
Drugs acting against a specific form of viral replication for heart cells can be effective.
(3) Cell degradation and transport molecules: SARS-COV-2 alters cell degradation to block virus removal and promote virus replication by making transport molecules as replication sites.
(4) Immune response: Patient immune response is altered to evade paitent cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by impairing immune cells.
Efficiency of immune-system-suppressing therapy must be explained.
(5) Intentional cell death: SARS-CoV-2 blocks intentional cell death in early stages and causes cell death in later stages.
(6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to damaged energy metabolism that leads to a decrease in energy and reactive chemical production.
(7) Virus channels: SARS-CoV-2 pokes openings in the cell that leads to leaking of important cell molecules.
This leaking causes cell death, altered cell signals, and an irregular heart beat.
