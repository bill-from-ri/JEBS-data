How can covid cause cell injury?

SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), has caused a global pandemic that has hurt both public health and the economy.
A protein of the virus has several purposes and plays an important role in creating the protective outer shell of the virus and helping the virus replicate itself.
In order to better understand how the virus protein works, proteins within human cells that interact with the COVID-19 protein were identified.
The authors identified 160 proteins within two different human cell types that interact in some way with the COVID-19 protein.
The human proteins found to interact with the virus protein are responsible for several cell functions, all of which impact the creation of more proteins.
Additionally, some human proteins identified to interact with the virus protein have roles in defending the body from viruses.
This study thoroughly characterized how the viral protein and the host (or human) protein interact when a person is infected. These findings can provide a foundation for future studies on the development and treatment options for COVID-19.
