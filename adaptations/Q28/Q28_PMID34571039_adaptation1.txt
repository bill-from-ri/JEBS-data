How can covid cause cell injury?

The ongoing global pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease). It has threatened public health and drawn worldwide attention.
The short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges.
Patients with COVID-19 present a wide range of symptoms of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).
It is essential to better understand how COVID-19 affects the nervous system. Increasing current understanding will reduce the long-term effects COVID-19 may cause within the brain.
Despite rapid progress in better understanding how COVID-19 hurts the human body, the long-term effects of the virus on the brain are still unclear.
There are several possible ways COVID-19 affects the central nervous system. One of these ways is by potentially hurting nerve cells. Second, the virus may cause body-wide inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) that may activate the immune system. Third, COVID-19 may be highly attracted to a specific pathway into cells and can then rapidly distribute throughout the body. Fourth, the virus may cause disease by decreasing oxygen and increase blood clotting within the body. And lastly, COVID-19 may cause body-wide inflammation that decreases brain function.
Despite not fully understanding how COVID-19 causes nerve injury, the authors hoped to provide a review of clinical reports, documented human health effects, and potential pathways of COVID-19-caused brain damage.
The aim of this paper was to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-caused brain damage. Additionally, the authors hope this can help predict COVID-19 related effects before they occur and decrease viral spread in general.
