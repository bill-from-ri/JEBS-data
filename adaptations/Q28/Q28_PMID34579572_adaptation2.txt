How can covid cause cell injury?

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory disease, highlights harmful effects of antibodies, body molecules that combat foreign organisms.
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a big concern because of the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, upon reinfection and the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines.

We found that certain cell molecules affect mild ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2.
Although certain immune cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants had infection enhancement, proinflammatory molecules were not increased in these cells.
SARS-CoV-2 infection thus creates antibodies that cause ADE of infection, but these antibodies do not lead to increased inflammatory molecule production by certain cells.
Viruses infect cells via certain cell parts.
ADE of infection or improvement of infection is another method of infection for viruses to infect immune cells influenced by antibodies and certain cellular molecules.
Because ADE of infection leads to disease symptoms of some viruses, understanding how ADE works and leads to these symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 is important.
Using blood from COVID-19 patients, we found two cellular molecules that influence ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
While ADE of infection was seen for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, proinflammatory molecule production in certain immune cells was not increased.
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection may create antibodies that cause ADE of infection, but these antibodies may not lead to increased inflammatory production by certain cells during infection.
