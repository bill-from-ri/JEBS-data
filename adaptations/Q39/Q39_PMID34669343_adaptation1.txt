What is a biomarker?

This literature review investigates the role of disease biomarkers in the management of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR refers to damaged blood vessels in the eye. Biomarkers are measurable substances in the body that are indicators of illness. Additionally, this review investigates the problem of retinal neurodegeneration, or nerve damage, in such patients.
Evaluating the significance of various biomarkers of DR and neurodegeneration can complement screening examinations. Additionally, evaluating significant biomarkers can help predict the course of the disease and what type of therapy is appropriate.
Analysis of these factors allows for effective treatment and prevention of complications in patients with DR.
