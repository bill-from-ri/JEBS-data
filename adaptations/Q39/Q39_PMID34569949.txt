What is a biomarker?

Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology.
However, clinical feature of PPA based on Aβ positivity remains unclear.
Objective: We aimed to assess the prevalence of Aβ positivity in patients with PPA and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with Aβ-positive (A+) and Aβ-negative (A-) PPA.
Further, we applied Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA for whom additional information of in vivo tau biomarker was available.
Methods: We recruited 110 patients with PPA (41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) who underwent Aβ-PET imaging at multi centers.
The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups using general linear models.
Results: The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), followed by ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%).
The A+ PPA subgroup manifested cortical atrophy mainly in the left superior temporal/inferior parietal regions and had lower repetition scores compared to the A-PPA subgroup.
Further, we observed that more than 90%(13/14) of the patients with A+ PPA had tau deposition.
Conclusion: Our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and cortical atrophy in patients with PPA based on Aβ deposition.
Considering that most of the A+ PPA patents are tau positive, understanding the influence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on PPA might provide an opportunity for these patients to participate in clinical trials aimed for treating atypical Alzheimer's disease.
