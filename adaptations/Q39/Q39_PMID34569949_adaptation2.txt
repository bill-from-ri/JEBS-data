What is a biomarker?

Pimary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language and speech brain disorder, is linked with amyloid-β (Aβ), a brain protein segment associated with Alzheimer's disease.
However, symptoms of PPA based on Aβ presence is unclear.
We assess the amount of Aβ presence in patients with PPA and compare the symptoms of PPA patients with Aβ presence of Aβ-positive (A+) versus those without Aβ (A-).
We also classified Aβ and tau type in PPA patients with this available information.
We had 110 PPA patients (41 who can't understand words [svPPA], 27 who can't speak but understand words [nfvPPA], 32 who have trouble finding the right word [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) undergo Aβ imaging at multiple centers.
The extent of language impairment and brain damage were compared between tehe A+ and A- PPA subgroups.
The proportion of Aβ presence was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), then ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%).
The A+ PPA subgroup had brain damage mainly on the left side in the middle regions and had worse scores compared to the A- PPA subgroup.
Also, over 90% (13/14) patients with A+ PPA had tau, a brain protein associated with Alzheimer's disease.
Our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and brain damage in PPA patients based on Aβ presence.
Since most A+ PPA patients have tau, understanding the effect of Alzheimer's disease markers on PPA may allow these patients to participate in clinical studies aimed for treating atypical Alzheimer's disease.
