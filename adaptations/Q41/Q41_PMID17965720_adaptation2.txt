What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

An inherited disorder of many kidney cysts (swellings) is an important cause of kidney failure, for which there is no treatment.
Gene sequence changes in PKD1 (a gene active in kidney cells) are the leading cause of the disease.
The disease begins before birth and worsens slowly, but it is not known if creation of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life.
We show that silencing of Pkd1 in mice younger than 13 days leads to severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks. Silencing at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 4 months.
We found that cell growth is not higher in those with cysts versus similar-age healthy animals, but the sudden change in response to Pkd1 silencing was linked to a new brake point during kidney growth and changes in gene expression.
The effects of Pkd1 silencing may be defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the final kidney maturation process.
Pkd1 monitors development of tubes in growing and adult kidneys, but the disease-related effects of silencing are defined by the organ's developmental status.
These results influence clinical understanding of the disease and treatment options.
