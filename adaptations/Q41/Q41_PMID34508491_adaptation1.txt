What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

Cystic Echinococcosis, also called Hydatid disease, is caused by the infection of a long tapeworm called Echinococcus granulosus, after it has hatched into the larval stage.
A person can often have this condition without symptoms for years before the cyst (growth) grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs.
The most common organs involved are the liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, central nervous system (spinal cord and brain), and kidney may also be involved.
This case is about a young woman who presented with left back pain and urinary tract infection (UTI - bladder infection) who was later diagnosed as having left kidney hydatid cyst.
The cyst was about 7.8×6.6×8cm with multiple compartments at the lower pole cortex (lower part) of the left kidney.
A procedure that uses tiny incisions was performed to remove the cyst and some tissue around the cyst. No complications occurred after the procedure, and she was sent home with anti-worm medicine and other medications.
With timely management using several therapies, this condition is curable, and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.
