What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

Cystic Echinococcosis or Hydatid disease is caused by the infection with the larval stage of long tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus.
This condition often remains asymptomatic for years before the cyst grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs.
The most common organs involved are liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, central nervous system, and kidney may also be involved.
This case is about a young woman who presented with left flank pain and urinary tract infection who was later diagnosed as having left renal hydatid cyst.
The cyst was approximately 7.8×6.6×8cm with internal multiple septations at the lower pole cortex of the left kidney.
Laparoscopic pericystectomy was performed and with no postoperative complications, she was discharged on albendazole and other supportive medication.
With timely management using combination therapy, this condition is curable and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.
