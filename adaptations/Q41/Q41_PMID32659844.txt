What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

This consensus-based guideline was developed by all relevant German pediatric medical societies.
Ultrasound is the standard imaging modality for pre- and postnatal kidney cysts and should also exclude extrarenal manifestations in the abdomen and internal genital organs.
MRI has selected indications.
Suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should prompt consultation of a pediatric nephrologist.
Prenatal management must be tailored to very different degrees of disease severity.
After renal oligohydramnios, we recommend delivery in a perinatal center.
Neonates should not be denied renal replacement therapy solely because of their age.
Children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney do not require routine further imaging or nephrectomy, but long-term nephrology follow-up (as do children with uni- or bilateral kidney hypo-/dysplasia with cysts).
ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), nephronophthisis, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and HNF1B mutations cause relevant extrarenal disease and genetic testing is advisable.
Children with tuberous sclerosis complex, tumor predisposition (e. g. von Hippel Lindau syndrome) or high risk of acquired kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds.
Even asymptomatic children of parents with ADPKD (autosomal dominant PKD) should be monitored for hypertension and proteinuria.
Presymptomatic diagnostic ultrasound or genetic examination for ADPKD in minors should only be done after thorough counselling.
Simple cysts are very rare in children and ADPKD in a parent should be excluded.
Complex renal cysts require further investigation.
