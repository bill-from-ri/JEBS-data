What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

Cystic Echinococcosis or Hyadtid disease is caused by infection from baby Echinococcus granulosus, long tapeworms, and leads to cysts or swellings.
This disease often shows no symptoms for years before the swelling grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs.
Most common organs affected are the liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, spinal cord, and kidney may also be involved.
This case is a young woman with pain on the left side of the waist and infection in the urine-collecting tube due to a left kidney cyst from Hyadtid disease.
The cyst was around 7.8×6.6×8cm with many internal divisions at the lower part of the left kidney.
Cyst removal surgery by small incisions and a camera was performed with no issues post-operation. She was released with albendazole, anti-parasite medication, and other helpful medication.
With proper use of multiple treatments, Hyadtid disease is curable and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.
