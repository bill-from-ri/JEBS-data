What is the best thyroid drug?

Underactive thyroid is relatively common, occurring in about 5% of the general U.S. population 12 years and older.
The recommended treatment is a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication).
About 5%-10% of patients who use LT4 alone to regulate thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may have ongoing symptoms that patients and doctors may think are caused by underactive thyroid.
Science disagrees as to whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3 - another thryoid medication) to LT4 will improve these ongoing symptoms.
We look at whether combining LT4 and LT3 is the best way to treat patients with normal thyroid function but ongoing symptoms.
We searched PubMed in March 2017 using the terms "hypothyroid" or "hypothyroidism" and "triiodothyronine combination" or "T3 combination."
We looked at English articles in the last 10 years in addition to known articles.
We did not find strong proof that combining LT4 and LT3 worked to treat patients with underactive thyroids.
Genes that cause less conversion of T4 to T3 may explain unsuccessful treatment with LT4.
The benefit of adding LT3 to LT4 treatment is uncertain.
Ongoing symptoms in patients with normal thyroid function may be due to other causes. A doctor should determine the cause of the ongoing symptoms.
