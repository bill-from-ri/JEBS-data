What is the best thyroid drug?

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) occurs when immune cells mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells. It is the most common cause of reduced thyroid function.
Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, increases globally as an alternative treatment for many long-lasting diseases like high blood pressure, high blood fat, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
The current work evaluates how Nigella sativa affects thyroid function, blood protein levels, and physical measurements in those with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation.
Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation, aged 22 through 50, were randomly split into two groups receiving powdered Nigella sativa or inactive treatment daily for 8 weeks.

Using an herbal medicine reduced body weight and body mass index.
Blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid cell proteins decreased while thyroid product levels increased in the Nigella sative-treated group after 8 weeks.
The treatment group showed reduced blood vessel signaling protein.
No changes occured in the inactive treatment group.
Changes in waist to hip ratio and thyroid hormones were linked to changes in certain blood protein levels in the Nigella sative-treated group.
Nigella sativa may improve thyroid and general health in those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation).
Also, Nigella sativa (an herbal medicine) reduces blood vessel signaling protein in these patients.
Due to its health-promoting effect, this medicinal plant can be a useful treatment for Hashimoto's thyroidits.
