What is the best thyroid drug?

Thyroiditis covers multiple disorders represented by inflammation of the thyroid gland.
The most common disorder is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients have enlarged thyroids, reduced thyroid function, and increased proteins targeting thyroid products.
Levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone treatment) improves thyroid function and size.
Post-birth thyroiditis is temporary or lasting thyroid dysfunction occuring within a year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion.
Supplemental thyroid hormone release into the blood may cause excess thyroid function.
Temporary or permanent reduced thryoid function may follow excess thyroid function due to thyroid hormone depletion and destruction of hormone-producing cells.
Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function.
Beta blockers (common high blood pressure medication) can treat symptoms of the initial phase of excess thyroid function. Levothyroxine should be considered for later phases in women with high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.
Subacute or fairly rapid thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) is a temporary, thyroid-hormone-excess state with frontal neck pain, reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low iodine sensitivity.
Fairly rapid thyroiditis often follows an upper airway viral illness, thought to trigger inflammatory destruction of thyroid cells.
In most cases, the thyroid gland suddenly returns to normal after several months.
High-dose aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help give thyroid pain relief.
