What is the best thyroid drug?

Thyroiditis refers to medical conditions that include thyroid inflammation.
The most common type of thyroiditis is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients usually have a painless enlarged thyroid, underactive thyroid, and high levels of proteins made by the immune system to fight foreign substances.
Taking levothyroxine, a thyroid drug, improves underactive thyroid and may decrease thyroid size.
Short-lived or long-lasting thyroiditis can occur postpartum, within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion.
Overactive thyroid can be caused by stored thyroid hormone released to the blood.
Overactive thyroid may be followed by short-term or permanent underactive thyroid.
Patients should be checked for changes in thyroid function.
Beta blockers can improve overactive thyroid symptoms. Levothyroxine, a thyroid drug, can improve underactive thyroid symptoms in women with high blood levels of hormones that act as a messenger to the thyroid.
Subacute thyroiditis is short-lived and characterized by neck pain, low blood levels of hormones that acts as a messenger to the thyroid, and low thyroid function based on a common test.
Many subacute thyroiditis cases follow colds.
The thyroid usually returns to normal on its own after many months.
High-dose aspirin or similar over-the-counter pain relievers can be taken to relieve thyroid pain.
