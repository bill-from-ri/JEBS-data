What is the best thyroid drug?

Low thyroid function occurs in around 5% of the US population aged â‰¥12 years.
Levothyroxine (LT4) (a thyroid hormonal drug) is standard treatment.
Around 5-10% of patients with regular thyroid-stimulating hormone levels after LT4 may still have symptoms attributable to reduced thyroid funciton.
Experts debate if adding levotriiodothyronine (LT3), another manmade thyroid hormone, to LT4 will help lingering symptoms.
We explore evidence for and against LT4/LT3 double treatment for best treating patients with lingering thyroid issues.
We searched PubMed in March 2017 using the terms "hypothyroid" or "hypothyroidism" (low thyroid function) and "triiodothyronine combination" or "T3 combination" (thyroid hormonal drug therapy).

Current evidence does not support LT4/LT3 double treatment for those with reduced thyroid function.
Variations in genes blueprinting enzymes that convert thyroid hormone from one form to another may explain the lack of improvement with LT4 treatment.
However, studies of LT4/LT3 double treatment are not conclusive.
Lingering symptoms in patients with normal thyroids from LT4 therapy may be from other thyroid-unrelated causes, which should be investigated by the clinician.
