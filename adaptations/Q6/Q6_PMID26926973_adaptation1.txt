What is the best thyroid drug?

Overactive thyroid is when too much thyroid hormone produced, when too much stored thyroid hormone released, or when there are internal or external thyroid hormone sources outside the thyroid.
The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone made are Graves disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and results in an overactive thyroid, or when one or more glandular growths make extra thyroid hormone.
The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone released is thyroid inflammation, although the signs are the same as other causes.
Overactive thyroid can be treated with drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the thyroid.
Radiation therapy is the most widely used treatment in the United States.
The choice of treatment depends on the diagnosis, reasons not to use a particular method, how serious the overactive thyroid is, and what the patient wants.
