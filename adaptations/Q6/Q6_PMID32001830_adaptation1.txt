What is the best thyroid drug?

In the 1990s, selenium was found to be a part of a protein that helps produce thyroid hormone. Since this discovery, many scientists have studied how selenium might help thyroid health.
Selenium, which has antioxidant characteristics, is found in meat, seafood and grains.
The amount of selenium eaten varies across the world due to different soils and how much of it plants absorb.
Eating too much or too little selenium can cause health problems, with a small ideal range for consumption.
Studies that look at how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why show a relationship between eating too little selenium and higher rates of inflamed thyroid caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, Graves disease (a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and lead to an overactive thyroid), and enlarged thyroids.
Studies of people taking selenium who have long-term inflamed thyroids caused by thyroid cells attacked by infection-preventing cells generally have bloodwork that suggests more normal thyroid function but no improvement in symptoms.
In Graves disease, taking selenium might make overactive thyroid go away faster and make quality of life and eye problems better in people with mild thyroid eye disease.
Although selenium is only recommended for people with thyroid eye disease, doctors prescribe selenium for other thyroid problems.
Current and future studies might help determine who should take selenium based, for example, on blood selenium levels and heredity.
