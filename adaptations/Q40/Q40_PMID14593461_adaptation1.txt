Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), or malfunctioning veins, has a significant impact on a person's social and economic status.
Continual pressure in the circulatory system can result in skin damage before forming an ulcer (sore).
Venous ulcers (sores from irregular blood flow) affect 1-3% of the adult population.
Compression therapy provides the basis for noninvasive (nonsurgical) treatment of CVI.
It can be applied alone or in combination with invasive (e.g. surgery) strategies.
A variety of materials are available for compression therapy in the form of bandages or hosiery (legwear).
Knowledge of the different compression materials and how they work is important in choosing the correct compression treatment to meet health goals and patient needs.
The compression method applied should be monitored for any decrease in effectiveness.
The following article deals with this topic.
This paper presents a new option for compression therapy of crural (leg) ulcers. This paper also checks the effectiveness of the compression stockings during outpatient treatment.
