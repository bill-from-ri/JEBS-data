Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Aim: A review is given on the different tools of compression therapy and their mode of action.
Methods: Interface pressure and stiffness of compression devices, alone or in combination can be measured in vivo.
Hemodynamic effects have been demonstrated by measuring venous volume and flow velocity using MRI, Duplex and radioisotopes, venous reflux and venous pumping function using plethysmography and phlebodynamometry.
Oedema reduction can be measured by limb volumetry.
Results: Compression stockings exerting a pressure of ~20 mm Hg on the distal leg are able to increase venous blood flow velocity in the supine position and to prevent leg swelling after prolonged sitting and standing.
In the upright position, an interface pressure of more than 50 mmHg is needed for intermittent occlusion of incompetent veins and for a reduction of ambulatory venous hypertension during walking.
Such high intermittent interface pressure peaks exerting a "massaging effect" may rather be achieved by short stretch multilayer bandages than by elastic stockings.
Conclusion: Compression is a cornerstone in the management of venous and lymphatic insufficiency.
However, this treatment modality is still underestimated and deserves better understanding and improved educational programs, both for patients and medical staff.
