Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Background: A too high resting pressure of compression devices is poorly tolerated and may cause skin defects, especially in patients with concomitant arterial occlusive disease.
Aim: To investigate whether low compression pressure will improve venous pumping function in patients with venous incompetence.
Material and methods: Venous pumping function was assessed in 20 patients with severe reflux in the great saphenous vein by measuring ejection fraction (EF) using strain-gauge plethysmography.
Measurements were repeated after application of knee-high medical compression stockings and of inelastic bandages applied with a pressure of 20, 40 and 60 mmHg in the supine position.
Results: EF was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls.
Compression stockings exerting a median pressure of 27 mmHg (interquartile range [IQR] 25-29) in the supine and 30.5 mmHg (IQR 28.25-34.25) in the standing position produced a moderate, non-significant improvement of EF of 17%.
Inelastic bandages with a resting pressure of 20.5 mmHg (IQR 20-22) in the supine position resulting in a standing pressure of 36 mmHg (IQR 33-40.75) led to a significant increase of EF of 61.5% (P < 0.01).
A further increase of the resting pressure to 40 and 60 mmHg achieved an increase of the EF of 91% and 98%, respectively (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: In patients with venous pumping failure, inelastic bandages produce a significant pressure-dependent increase of EF.
A significant improvement in venous pumping function was achieved with inelastic bandages even at a resting pressure of 20 mmHg.
