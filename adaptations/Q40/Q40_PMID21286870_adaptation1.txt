Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Although compression therapy was first described over 2,000 years ago, many patients with edema do not receive appropriate compression therapy. Edema is swelling within the body due to excess fluid build up.
Instead, most patients with swelling are treated primarily with diuretics (drugs that promote urination).
Compression therapy is a vital treatment for venous edema (vein swelling) and lymphatic disorders (disorders of the body's drainage system).
Compression therapy decreases the foot and leg volume. Compression therapy also reduces venous reflux and venous hypertension. Venous reflux is abnormal back up of blood in the veins. Venous hypertension is abnormal blood pressure.
Compression can be achieved by multiple different methods. These methods include inelastic bandages; multilayered wraps; short, medium, and long stretch bandages; graduated (pressure-varying) compression stockings; and pneumatic (inflatable) compression devices.
The major criticism of compression therapy is that patients do not always comply with orders.
Compliance with doctor orders can be increased by selecting the right compression therapy for the individual patient. Patients should also be provided with adequate education on the treatment.
