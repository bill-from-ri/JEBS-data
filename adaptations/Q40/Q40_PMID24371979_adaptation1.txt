Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Compression therapy is the basic therapy when treating the circulatory (blood) or lymphatic (body drainage) system.
The pressure under the bandages has to exceed the intravenous pressure, especially when standing. Intravenous pressure is the pressure of blood in veins.
Different compression materials work differently on ambulatory venous hypertension (excess pressure in veins). The material used can affect both the rate in which swelling is reduced and blood flow. Some compression materials include short stretch systems, long stretch bandages, and compression garments.
Compression with very stiff materials is more effective than compression with low stiffness, elastic materials.
These materials have to be placed correctly.
Inelastic systems should be applied with high initial pressure. This is because the pressure will decrease after walking.
Even after one week of wearing, inelastic bandages keep higher optimal pressure during walking than elastic bandages.
More importantly, inelastic bandages have lower resting pressure than elastic materials.
Long stretch bandages and compression garments that are able to stretch ensure low working pressure and higher resting pressure than short stretch systems.
