Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Venous (gravitational) leg ulcers (leg sores) are unappealing to the eye, sometimes painful, and often difficult to heal.
They are associated with incompetence of valves in the deep leg veins and venous hypertension (high blood pressure in veins).
There are several approaches used in the management of venous leg ulcers. These approaches focus on reducing the 'back pressure' or 'reverse pressure' in the veins. These approaches include surgical removal of any varicose veins (twisted, enlarged veins), postural drainage (elevation of the legs when the patient is lying or seated), and use of compression therapy with bandages, hosiery (legwear) or intermittent (periodic) pneumatic (inflatable) compression.
This article reviews the success and correct use of compression therapy.
