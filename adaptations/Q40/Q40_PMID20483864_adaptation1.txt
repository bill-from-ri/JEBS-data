Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

A too high resting pressure of compression devices, or when the device is just lying on the skin, is poorly tolerated and may cause skin defects. This is especially common in patients with concomitant arterial occlusive disease, blockage of an artery.
The goal of this study was to investigate if low compression pressure improves vein pumping function in patients with defective veins.
Vein pumping function was assessed (measured) in 20 patients with severe reflux, or the backup of blood, in the great saphenous vein in the leg. This was done by measuring ejection fraction (EF; percentage of blood leaving the heart when it contracts).
Measurements were taken after application of knee-high medical compression stockings and of inelastic bandages applied while lying down.
Results showed EF was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls.
Compression stockings produced a moderate, non-significant improvement of EF.
Inelastic bandages led to a significant increase of EF.
Increased pressure of the inelastic bandages achieved an increase of the EF.
The study concluded that, in patients with venous (vein) pumping failure, inelastic bandages produce a significant pressure-dependent increase of EF. This means that as pressure increases, EF increases.
Significant improvement in venous pumping function was achieved with inelastic bandages, even at resting pressures.
