What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Orofacial pain syndromes are diseases known to cause pain in the face and mouth. 
We discuss clinical examinations of the neural system that help identifying trigeminal nerve pain and other chronic facial pain conditions, but not headaches and problems with TMJ.
The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading Painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains.
Clinical examinations of the nervous system help identifying painful conditions of the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. These conditions may start after an injury (posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy) or herpes infection (postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy). Other related conditions are burning mouth syndrome (a burning, scalding, or tingling feeling in the mouth) and persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, which is described as continuing pain in the face and teeth of unknown cause. 
Even patients who appear normal on clinical examination have damage to their nervous system that can cause trigeminal nerve pain. 
Diagnostic tests include recording electrical signals in the muscles (electroneuromyography), MRI of the nerves around the eyes, blink reflexes and jaw jerk when different nerves are stimulated, recording electrical signals after the nerves are stimulated, and tests for pain sensation. 
Responsiveness of the blink reflex and records of the electrical signals after repeated nerve stimulation show if the response is suppressed. Medical imaging called navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation shows the areas of the brain that change due to chronic nerve pain. 
Consistent use of the above tests will help understanding the chronic facial pain conditions.
