Post-traumatic trigeminal neuralgia (PTTN), also known as anesthesia dolorosa, is at times a debilitating affliction, but remains a condition with minimal research and without definitive treatment, specifically in the periorbital and malar regions.
Below we present a case of PTTN in a patient with historic facial trauma who has successfully achieved resolution of pain.
We describe diagnostic and therapeutic anesthesia blocks and ablative procedures targeting the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves.
We promote awareness for the procedures and the potential large impact on the oral and maxillofacial surgery community when treating those suffering from facial pain.
Finally, we present an algorithm that can aid surgeons in diagnosing and treating patients with PTTN.
