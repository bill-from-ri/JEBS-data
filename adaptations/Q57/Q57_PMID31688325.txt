What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Orofacial pain syndromes encompass several clinically defined and classified entities.
The focus here is on the role of clinical neurophysiologic and psychophysical tests in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and pathophysiological mechanisms of definite trigeminal neuropathic pain and other chronic orofacial pain conditions (excluding headache and temporomandibular disorders).
The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading Painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains.
In addition to unambiguous painful posttraumatic or postherpetic trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, and trigeminal neuralgia have also been identified with neurophysiologic and quantitative sensory testing to involve the nervous system.
Despite normal clinical examination, these all include clusters of patients with evidence for either peripheral or central nervous system pathology compatible with the subclinical end of a continuum of trigeminal neuropathic pain conditions.
Useful tests in the diagnostic process include electroneuromyography with specific needle, neurography techniques for the inferior alveolar and infraorbital nerves, brain stem reflex recordings (blink reflex with stimulation of the supraorbital, infraorbital, mental, and lingual nerves; jaw jerk; masseter silent period), evoked potential recordings, and quantitative sensory testing.
Habituation of the blink reflex and evoked potential responses to repeated stimuli evaluate top-down inhibition, and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation allows the mapping of reorganization within the motor cortex in chronic neuropathic pain.
With systematic use of neurophysiologic and quantitative sensory testing, many of the current ambiguities in the diagnosis, classification, and understanding of chronic orofacial syndromes can be clarified for clinical practice and future research.
