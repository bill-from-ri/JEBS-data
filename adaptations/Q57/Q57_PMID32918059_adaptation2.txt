What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Facial pain may be hard to recognize and a specialist might need to examine the patient. 
The study's aim was to identify the mix of patient cases at a specialist facial pain clinic. 
We reviewed the records of 112 patients who visited the specialists at the facial pain clinic.
We compared the reasons for specialist consultation  given by the primary doctors to the diagnoses made by the specialists. 
Most often the primary doctors thought the patients' pain was caused by problems with the  temporomandibular joints that connect the lower jaw to the skull; pain in the trigeminal nerve that sends signals about sensations in the face to the brain; and other facial pain.
Over a quarter of patients referred to the cliniic had no diagnosis.
The specialist could not diagnose only one patient and have not diagnosed any patients with unspecified facial pain. 
The specialists found causes of all previously unspecified facial pain. Many patients had trigeminal nerve pain following an injury (Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain ). 
Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain started after dental treatment or injury.
Unspecified facial pain is rare and may be overused by dentists and physicians. 
All other causes should be excluded before diagnosis of the unspecified facial pain.
This will improve treatment and patients' expectations. It may reduce unnecessary referrals.
