Trigeminal nerve pain (neuralgia) is caused by pressure on the trigeminal (meaning "threefold", for the three branches of the nerve)  nerve. The pressure leads to gradual loss of the protecting layer that covers the nerve. 
It arises spontaneously and unexpected. 
The spinal cord is the bundle of nerve tissues that connects the brain with the body. In the upper neck region, it contains parts of the trigeminal nerve. 
The trigeminal nerve cells and fibers enter the brainstem, the bottom part of the brain connected to the spinal cord, and go down to the second vertebrae at the top of the cervical spine. 
A rare patient had severe repeated bouts of facial pain after an injury to the second vertebrae at the top of the neck region. 
This patient reminds us that trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by injuries to the head and neck.
