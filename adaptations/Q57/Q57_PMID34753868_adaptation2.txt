Occipital Neuralgia is the pain in the occipital nerves, the nerves that run from the top of the spinal cord up in the back of the head.
It is considered a type of headaches, but some doctors suggest pain in the nerves in the back of the head is a different problem.
Occipital neuralgia is a continuing, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears. It can also extend to the front of the head.
The doctors decide the patients have the disease if the pain in the back of the patients' heads comes and goes. 
Most patients have pain on one side of their head, but the pain could also be on both sides and extend to the front of the head and face.
When the doctors examine the patients, the patients' skin over the nerves in the back of the head  may be tender.
Drugs like lidocaine can block the feeling of pain in these nerves. Drugs that reduce inflammation, such as steroids may be added to keep the signs from happening. 
Other treatments like botulinum toxin that blocks the nerve signals and radiofrequency ablation that uses radio waves to shrink tissues may be promising but need to be studied more.  
Surgeons may permanently relieve the pressure on the nerve by removing a small muscle between the neck vertebra at the base of the head, but this treatment is risky.
