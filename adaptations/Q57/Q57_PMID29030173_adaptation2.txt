What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

This study presents a new wireless nerve stimulation system for treatment of uncontrollable pain of the head and face. 
Previous studies reported that stimulation of the nerves called trigeminal (meaning "threefold", for the three branches of the nerve)  and occipital (relating to the back of the head) reduces pain in the head and face. 
Due to the shortcomings of the devices and concerns about the appearance, the nerve stimulation systems are not used widely.  
The relatively common complications are worn and broken wires, devices moving from the original placement, and infection around the device. To avoid these complications, we need to change the nerve stimulation systems and the way they are implanted (placed) in the head and face. 
We describe a new peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system for treatment of pain in the head and neck. The system is wireless and is placed using small cuts and few stitches. 
The doctors place the system under the skin, next to the damaged facial nerves 
This study included ten patients who experienced chronic headaches and facial pain for four or more hours a day and at least 15 days a month.
Four weeks after the systems were implanted, all patients felt continuing ain relief. 
The patients had different numbers of wires and implant locations.
On average, patients felt five times less pain after treatment. 
There were no complications
Placing a wireless nerve stimulation device under the skin next to the damaged nerves in the head and neck reduces pain that is hard to control otherwise. This treatment is gentle and can be reversed.
