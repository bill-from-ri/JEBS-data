What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Introduction: Facial pain (FP) is a type of neuropathic pain which recognizes both central and peripheral causes.
It can be difficult to treat because it can often become resistant to pharmacological treatments.
Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS) has been used in selected cases, but the correct indications of MCS in FP have not been fully established.
Here we systematically reviewed the literature regarding MCS in FP analysing the results of this technique and studying the possible role of different factors in the prognosis of these patients.
Methods: A literature search was performed through different databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) according to PRISMA guidelines using the following terms in any possible combination: "facial pain" or "trigeminal" or "anaesthesia dolorosa" and "motor cortex stimulation."
Results: 111 articles were reviewed, and 12 studies were included in the present analysis for a total of 108 patients.
Overall, at latest follow-up (FU), 70.83% of patients responded to MCS.
The preoperative VAS significantly decreased at the latest FU (8.83 ± 1.17 and 4.31 ± 2.05, respectively; p < 0.0001).
Younger age (p = 0.0478) and a peripheral FP syndrome (p = 0.0006) positively affected the definitive implantation rate on univariate analysis.
Younger age emerged as a factor strongly associated to a higher probability to go to a definitive MCS implant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.0415).
Conclusion: Our results evidenced the effectiveness of MCS in treating FP.
Moreover, the younger age emerged as a positive prognostic factor for definitive implantation.
Further studies with longer FU are needed to better evaluate the long-term results of MCS.
