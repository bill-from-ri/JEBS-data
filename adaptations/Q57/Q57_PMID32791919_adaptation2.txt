What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Neuralgia is pain in the nerves that feels as bursts of electric-shock-like pain.
Up tp half of the patients also experience continuous pain.
We study the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root (a part of the nerve that helps the face recognize pain, touch, heat and cold sensations, as well as chewing. We studied patients with continuous pain.
We studied 73 patients with trigeminal neuralgia (nerve pain) and 40 healthy participants.
The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians.
45 patients had only Burts of pain and 28 patients had continuous pain along with the bursts.
All patients had clinical examination and MRI. 
Two specialists studied the images without losing at the clinical data. 
In most patients with continuous pain it started as burning, throbbing or aching sensation. 
The patients in the two groups and the frequency and location of the nerve damage signs in these patients were similar
On the contrary, patients with both the bursts and continuous pain had more atrophy ((decrease in size) of the trigeminal nerve than the patients with bursts only. 
Clinical examination of patients with trigeminal nerve pain and their medical images show that patients who experienced continuous pain along with pain bursts lost some nerve tissues. This type of pain is related to wrong signaling in the nerve that lost tissues.
