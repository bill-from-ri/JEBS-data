How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

For the study's purpose, the vast majority of mutations for epilepsy (a brain disease causing seizures) syndromes such as genetic epilepsy with fever-related seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (DS) (lifelong epilepsy) occur in the specific gene SCN1A.
For the study's methods, 63 individuals with either DS or GEFS + syndrome were tested for SCN1A gene mutation using gene labeling techniques.
Our research study found 15 new disease-cuasing mutations in the SCN1A gene, of which 12 appeared to be mutations with three deletions, two of which shifted the entire gene.
The distribution of clinical physical effects in patients carrying SCN1A mutations was as follows: twelve patients had classical DS, three patients had GEFS + syndrome and two relatives of DS patients were suffering from fever-related seizures.
In conclusion, our study highlights the physical effects and gene-related differences of DS and GEFS + with the important aim of gaining a deeper understanding of SCN1A-related disorders.
This study also represents the first genetic analysis of the SCN1A gene in a Hungarian group with the DS and GEFS + syndrome physical make-up.
