How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

We aim to describe the spectrum of detected gene mutations in patients with epilepsy (brain disorder with seizures) in clinical practice of brain physicians specializing in epilepsy with an analysis of identified epileptic diseases, the characteristics of seizures, the timing of a genetic diagnosis, options and treatment effectiveness.
The study included 100 patients (40 boys, 60 girls) with epilepsy and/or epileptic encephalopathy (epilepsy that leads to brain damage) and a gene mutation identified.
The average age was 6.9Â±5.1 years.
Through remote access, epilepsy specialists filled out a specially designed data table containing information from patient history.
The results show there are patients with a wide range of gene mutations, the leading of which is a mutation in the specific gene called SCN1A (15%).
The main method (85%) of detection remains the gene labeling of the last group in the Â«Hereditary EpilepsyÂ panel, groups of genes linked with epilepsy.
Years pass from the start of the disease to the genetic diagnosis (average number is 3 years).
In most cases, patients with severe (52% have epileptic encephalopathy, 88% have growth disorders) and drug-resistant (average amount of anti-epileptic drugs - 3.8Â±2.2, multi-treatment - 70%) diseases have undergone genetic testing.
In the treatment of these patients, epilepsy specialists are increasingly (52%) using alternative methods: steroids, ketogenic (low-carb) diet and others.
The lack of seizures was observed only in 46% of patients.
In conclusion, in the practice of epilepsy specialists, patients with a wide range of gene mutations are found.
As a rule, these are patients with severe, treatment-resistant epileptic diseases.
