To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

The aim is to measure blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in a baseline group of pregnant women and group with gestational diabetes (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women).
To define a normal baseline level of blood ketone bodies, made from fat breakdown, and determine if this value could aid management of pregnant women with gestational diabetes or high blood sugar.
Fifty-six standard women and 49 with gestational diabetes were measured from the 25th to 37th week of pregnancy.
Standard women performed measurements of blood sugar and blood ketone bodies 3 times a day.
Also, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were asked to measure after-meal blood sugar.
Blood and ketone measurements were recorded.
Patients kept a 24-hour food record twice a week.
Average blood ketone bodies were lower in the standard group than the group with gestational diabetes.
Blood ketone bodies measured before the midday and evening meals were lower for standard patients than gestational diabetics.
Fasting blood ketone bodies were unrelated to urinary ketone bodies in the pregnant gestational diabetics, unlike the standard group.
At least one long-lasting increase in blood ketone bodies occured in 47% of pregnant women with gestational diabetes compared to only 12% of standard patients.
The lowest levels of evening blood sugar paralleled the highest levels of blood ketone bodies. Pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar reported lower food and carb intakes than standard women.
This work created baselines of blood ketone bodies in non-diabetic pregnant women.
If blood ketone bodies do indicate restricting diets, this value may monitor faithfulness to diet recommendations for pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar.
