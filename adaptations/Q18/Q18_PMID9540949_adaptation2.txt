To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

The objective is to determine how carb restriction affects births in diet-controlled gestational diabetics, in which high blood sugar affects pregnant women.
Diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were divided non-randomly based on dietary carb intake: a low-carb intake group (below 42%) or high-carb intake group (over 45%).
Subjects kept diet records and were followed with daily blood sugar measurements.
Subjects also were tested daily for ketones in urine.
Certain blood sugar and birth-related measurements were compared between groups.
The two groups had identical socioeconomic traits.
The low-carb group had reduced after-meal glucose levels.
Less patients in the low-carb group needed insulin for glucose control.
The frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants was lower in the low-carb group.
The low-carb group also had less cesarean deliveries for large-head babies and large-body babies.
Carb restriction in diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar improves blood sugar control, reduces need for insulin, reduces frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants, and reduces cesarean deliveries for large-head and large-body babies.
