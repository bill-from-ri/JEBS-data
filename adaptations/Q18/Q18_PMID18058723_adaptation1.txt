To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

Nutrition therapy (treatment that uses food to prevent and reverse disease) is a key part of the care of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy).
Most women with GDM are treated only by managing their nutrition.
The goal of this study is to compare low and high carbohydrate (carbohydrates that provide fuel for the body often found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread) diets.
The study group has 30 white women newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus.
The patients are randomly put into two groups: those on a low carbohydrate (carb) diet and those on a high carb diet.
The presence of urine ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar) is controlled every day.
After two weeks, how well women stayed on the recommend diets and daily blood sugar measures were analyzed.
Blood sugar levels before starting the new diets did not differ between the two groups.
No changes in fasting blood sugar (blood sugar levels after not eating for set amount of time) are noticed in the group that has a low carb diet, although a significant decrease in blood sugar is seen after breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
In the high carb diet group, fasting and after breakfast blood sugar levels did not change.
A significant decrease in glycaemia (concentration of blood sugar) is noticed after lunch.
Ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) is not observed in either group.
Pregnancy outcomes did not differ between the two groups.
In conclusion, both high and low carb diets are effective and safe.
A diet that limits carbs should be recommended to women who experience the highest concentration of blood sugar levels after breakfast.
