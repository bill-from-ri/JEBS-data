To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) plays an important role in the care of gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of high blood sugar affecting pregnant women), and it has a significant impact on women and newborns.
The main objective of MNT is to make sure to have enough pregnancy weight gain and fetus (unborn baby) growth while having stable blood sugar levels (euglycemia) and avoiding ketones (alternative fuels for the body made when blood sugar is low).
However, the best diet remains an unanswered question.
Overall, the nutritional and food requirements for gestational diabetes mellitus are similar for all pregnancies, but special attention is paid to carbohydrates (foods that provide sugar and energy for the body).
Despite the usual care practice of limiting carbohydrates, the latest evidence, although limited, favors a low-glycemic index diet (a diet that helps control blood sugar from spiking).
There is general agreement in studies about limiting calories in the case of being overweight or obese.
Experimental studies are necessary to investigate the best medical nutrition therapy for gestational diabetes mellitus because this knowledge may provide health benefits and save money.
