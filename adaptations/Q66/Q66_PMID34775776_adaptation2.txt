Nephrotic syndrome what happens when gets bad?

Chylothorax is an uncommon and serious medical condition where fluid from the lymphatic system builds up around the lungs. It is typically caused by serious damage to the body, either after surgery or an accident. However, we donâ€™t know how a cluster of kidney-related symptoms called Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) causes chylothorax.
In this article we describe a case of NS with a kidney disease called Membranous Nephropathy (MN) in a 66 year old man with severe chylothorax.
The chylothorax was kept under control with a drainage tube inserted into the chest, injections of a drug called enoxaparin, and treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and diuretics, which increase urine production.
After treatment, the fluid around the lungs decreased and became clear.
We will talk about the causes of MN with chylothorax.
We thought that maybe too little protein in the blood allowed fluid from the lymphatic system to leak through tissues and cause the buildup around the lungs.
The chylothorax may also have been caused by severe swelling and increased pressure. This could have caused fluid to seep through or rupture the walls of lymph vessels (which are similar to blood vessels) and leak into the chest cavity.
Since MN is rare, we hope this case report will help doctors to understand problems associated with MN in patients that have NS, and that it will provide treatment options for doctors in the future.
