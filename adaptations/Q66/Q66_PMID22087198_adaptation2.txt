Nephrotic syndrome what happens when gets bad?

Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is one of the most common kidney diseases in children.
Most of the time, looking at kidney tissue under a microscope shows that there is Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome (MCNS).
Most people with MCNS can be cured without other issues. 
However, some children with NS have a different form called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Children with this form have excess protein in their urine for long periods of time and are at high risk for additional problems.
Additional problems caused by NS come in two categories: problems caused by the disease, and problems caused by drugs used to treat the disease.
Problems caused by the disease include infections, blood clots, shock, heart disease, kidney failure, anemia, and others.
The main way NS causes problems is from the large loss of proteins from the blood through urine.
Most children with MCNS that is treatable with drugs have fewer additional problems that children with NS that drugs cannot help.
Several drugs have been used to treat NS. These drugs can cause additional problems when used to treat NS.
Finding additional problems early will improve results for patients with NS.
