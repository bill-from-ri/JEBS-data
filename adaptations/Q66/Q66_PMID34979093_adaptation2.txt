Nephrotic syndrome what happens when gets bad?

Blood clots are a well-known problem associated with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), a group of kidney-related symptoms. However, the risks of blood clots and bleeding in adults with NS is not clear.
This study looked at groups of similar people with and without disease. In it, we found every adult that had NS recorded for the first time from 1995 to 2018 at admissions, outpatient clinics, and emergency department visits in Denmark.
Each patient was matched by age and sex with 10 individuals from the general population.
We estimated the 10-year risk of recorded blood clots and bleeding, accounting for risk of death.
Using a statistical model, we calculated how likely the patients were to have certain outcomes compared to the general population.
Among 3,967 adults with first-time NS, the risk of having a blood clot in an artery within one year was 4%. The risk of a blood clot in a vein in the same time was 3%, and the risk of bleeding was 5%.
Within 10 years, the risk of a blood clot in an artery was 14%, the risk of a blood clot in a vein was 8%, and the risk of bleeding was 17%. The highest bleeding risks were of stroke, heart attack, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
During the first year, patients with NS had higher rates of blood clots in arteries, blood clots in veins, and bleeding than the people from the general population.
In conclusion, adults with NS have a higher risk of blood clots, both in arteries and veins, and bleeding compared to the general population.
We still need to figure out how this happens and what the consequences are.
