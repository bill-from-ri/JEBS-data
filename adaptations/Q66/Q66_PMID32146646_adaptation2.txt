Nephrotic syndrome what happens when gets bad?

New discoveries in treatments that suppress the immune system have helped patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), a group of symptoms relating to the kidneys. However, the safety and effectiveness of these treatments has not been fully studied for recent cases in Japan.
A study 5 years ago followed 374 patients with NS in Japan, across 55 hospitals. It included 155 patients with Minimal Change Disease (MCD), 148 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN), 38 patients with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and 33 patients with other types of inflammation of the small filtering structures in the kidney.
Among these diseases, we compared how often proteinuria (too much protein in the urine) was cured and came back. We also compared how often patients died, had kidney failure, or had other serious problems.
The most common cause of death was being hospitalized for an infection. We compared this cause among the different diseases using statistical methods.
We found that treatment to suppress the immune system was given to 339 patients.
For patients with MCD, MN, FSGS, there was more than a 75% chance the disease was completely cured within 3 years.
The most common side effect of treatments suppressing the immune system was diabetes. In each year, a person had a 71 in 1000 chance of this happening.
Death from any cause, about half of which caused by infections, was more common than kidney failure, especially in patients with MCD and MN.
MCD was more associated with hospitalization for infections than MN.
Patients with MCD and MN were more likely to die, especially from infections, than to have kidney failure.
We also conclude that doctors should pay more attention to infections in patients with NS.
