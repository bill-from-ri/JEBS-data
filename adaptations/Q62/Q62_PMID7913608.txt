I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

First-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), frequently cause somnolence or other CNS adverse effects.
Second-generation H1-antagonists, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, represent a true advance in therapeutics.
In manufacturers' recommended doses, they have a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than their predecessors with regard to lack of CNS effects, and do not exacerbate the adverse CNS effects of alcohol or other CNS-active chemicals.
Rarely, some of the newer H1-antagonists may cause cardiac dysrhythmias after overdose or under other specific conditions.
The concept of a risk-free H1-antagonist is proving to be an oversimplification.
An H1-antagonist absolutely free from adverse effects under all circumstances is not yet available for use.
The magnitude of the beneficial effects of each H1-antagonist should be related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the CNS and cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be developed for each medication in this class.
