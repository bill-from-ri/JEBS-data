Antihistamines, drugs that help with allergies, often cause drowsiness.
We studied young adults' brains during tests of mental processes after taking antihistamines. 
18 healthy young Japanese men took antihistamines levocetirizine and diphenhydramine  at least six days apart.
Their well-being, task performances, and brain activity were measured while checking their mental functions. 


After diphenhydramine, the brains consumed more energy but responded slower. 
Diphenhydramine, but not levocetirizine, lowered the accuracy of mental processes. 
There was no  difference in  sleepiness.
Antihistamines may effect human brain.
