We studied inappropriate use of drugs in elderly patients in the emergency departments. 
We also find out what causes inappropriate use of drugs and if it is sometimes done for a good reason. 
We studied visits to emergency departments in 1992-2000. 
Drugs that are dangerous for elderly and should be used with caution were listed by Dr. Beers in 1997. 



Drugs from the Beers' list were given about 16 million times (over a tenth of emergency visits by elderly) from 1992 to 2000.

Six drugs accounted for the majority of inappropriate use: promethazine, meperidine, propoxyphene, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, and diazepam.

There were almost no indications that the use of these drugs was potentially appropriate.
For example, less than half of patients that got diphenhydramine and less than 10th that got hydroxyzine had allergies.
Elderly patients often get inappropriate drugs in the emergency room. 
Potentially appropriate uses do not account for the given drugs.
Although the list of inappropriate drugs was published in 1997, it has not changed how the drugs are given.
