I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

Three commonly prescribed drugs (antihistamines) for itching caused by histamine, a chemical  the body releases during allergic reactions, were studied on 28 healthy people.
The drugs in identical capsules included Benadryl, Periactin, Atarax, and a placebo (a pill that contains no drug).
The thresholds of itching due to histamine were measured before and after taking the drugs. 
For Periactin and placebo, the dose of histamine that caused itching increased fivefold.
For Benadryl, the dose had to be 10 times higher, and for Atarax 750 times higher.
The most common side effect was drowsiness, which occurred with all three drugs.
