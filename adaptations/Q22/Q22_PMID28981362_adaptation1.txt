Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome involving multiple organs.
In young patients, kidney tumors that are numerous, in both kidneys, or both can suggest Birt-Hogg-Dubé.
Findings outside the kidney, such as changes in the skin, cysts (sacs filled with air) in the lungs, and the sudden collapse of the lung, also help in diagnosis.
In conclusion, radiologists (doctors who use x-rays and other electronic images to treat and diagnose patients) may be the first medical care provider to suggest a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé.
Knowledge of how the disease develops and how to manage the condition, including the importance of the types of kidney growths in a patient, is needed to properly recognize this rare condition.
