Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare inherited genetic disorder caused by changes in the gene FLCN that makes a protein called folliculin, which helps suppress tumor growth.
It is often associated with the development of multiple cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck, and chest (fibrofolliculomas), and kidney tumors.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé has no preference between male and female and often appears when people are in their 30s or 40s.
Multiple cysts on both lungs are identified using x-rays in more than 80% of patients. More than half experience one or more collapsed lung events which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall.
A family history of collapsed lung is an important clue and suggests a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé.
Unlike other cystic lung diseases, Birt-Hogg-Dubé does not lead to loss of lung function over time or to ongoing breathing problems.
Kidney tumors affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime. There can be multiple number of tumors, and they can be recurring.
The diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is based on a combination of genetic and medical characteristics and/or studying skin and skin cells with a microscope.
For a collapsed lung, care mostly involves doing a procedure called pleurodesis early that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall. Scanning the kidneys for tumors using x-rays and finding out if relatives have Birt-Hogg-Dubé are also ways to manage the disorder.
