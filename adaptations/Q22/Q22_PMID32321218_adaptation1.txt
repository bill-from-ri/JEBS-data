Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs), non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest called fibrofolliculomas, and kidney tumors.
The pulmonary cysts may lead to a collapsed lung when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. In cases of the major, sudden collapsed lung, Birt-Hogg-Dubé should be excluded.
The kidney tumors are frequently cancerous but slow-growing.
Screening and learning about the health history of family members help doctors discover kidney cancer at an early stage.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé is often missed or not recognized as a diagnosis.
