Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited disorder caused by heritable DNA mutations in the tumor stopping gene FLCN, used to create the protein folliculin.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome leads to lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, hair follicle and kidney tumors.
BHD has no sexual preference and appears in the 30's or 40's.
Multiple lung cysts in both lungs are detected in >80% of patients via medical imaging. >50% have one or more episodes of lungs collapsing.
A family history of collapsing lungs may help identify BHD.
Unlike other lung diseases with lung cysts or swellings, BHD does not lead to loss of lung function overtime and long-lasting breathing deficits.
Kidney tumors affect ~30% of patients and can be multiple and reoccuring.
Identifying BHD involves genetic, medical, and/or skin-related criteria.
Managing BHD involves removing the space between the lungs and chest wall to prevent collapsing lungs. It also involves constant kidney imaging for tumors and searching for BHD in relatives.
