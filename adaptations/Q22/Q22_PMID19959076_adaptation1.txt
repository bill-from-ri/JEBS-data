Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a genetic condition that is often accompanied by non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest, pulmonary cysts which are sacs of air in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and kidney cancer.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé is caused by genetic mutations in a gene that helps control cell growth called FLCN.
Diagnosing conditions using DNA allows insight in how the FLCN gene works, both within and between families.
Patients can present with skin signs and also with a collapsed lung (when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) or kidney cancer.
Prevention is mainly focused on early diagnosis and treatment of kidney cancer.
This paper gives an overview of current diagnosis and management of Birt-Hogg-Dubé.
