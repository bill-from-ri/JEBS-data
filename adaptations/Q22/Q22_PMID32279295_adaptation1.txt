Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is an genetic disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutations in the Folliculin gene (FLCN), a gene that stops or slows tumor growth.
A common characteristic of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs) that are mostly located in the bottom of the lung. There is also the risk of a collapsed lung, when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, non-cancerous skin tumors, and kidney cancer.
The FLCN protein has different functions in the body, including signaling to other cells and supervising the formation of other proteins.
Therefore, FLCN cells that are damaged are thought to have reduced activity in other proteins and increase activity in others that may lead to the development of kidney tumors.
Folliculin also has other functions including cleaning out damaged cells, helping cells connect with other cells, and working with enzymes that activate the proteins that regular cell energy and fuel.
How these functions contribute to the lung problems of Birt-Hogg-Dubé are largely unknown.
This review is focused on the lung problems of Birt-Hogg-Dubé and highlights recent advances in understanding the cell function of FLCN. The review also provides current ideas related to how cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dubé is formed.
Researchers also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including genetic, cell, and physical processes of cyst development, in addition to the  timing of when cysts first form.
