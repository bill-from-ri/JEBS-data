How often should i have a bone density test?

We looked at how helpful routine lab testing is for finding underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle).
Most men with and without osteoporosis had one or more abnormal lab measurement.
Few single lab abnormalities were more common in men with osteoporosis.
Routine lab testing in older men with osteoporosis may not be helpful.
We aim to rate how useful recommended lab testing is to find underlying causes of osteoporosis in older men by looking at the number of older men with lab abnormalities with and without osteoporosis during a specific period.
We studied 1,572 men 65 years old and older who has bone mineral density (BMD) testing and many other lab measurements.
We checked for links of any lab abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to find one more lab abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis.
We found that about 60% of men with and without osteoporosis had one or more lab abnormality.
Among lab tests, only not enough vitamin D and high alkaline phosphatase (suggesting damage to liver or bone disorder) were more likely in men with osteoporosis.
Too much cortisol (stress hormone) and overactive thyroid (metabolism-regulating hormone) were rare and not meaningfully more common in men with osteoporosis.
No men with osteoporosis had high levels of calcium in the urine.
Though most of these older men had one or more lab abnormality, few often-recommended tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without.
Except for possibly vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, usefulness of routine lab testing to find possible underlying causes in older men with osteoporosis seems low.
Results may not apply to younger men or to older men thought to have osteoporosis from underlying causes.
