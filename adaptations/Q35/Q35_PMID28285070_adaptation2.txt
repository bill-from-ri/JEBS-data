How often should i have a bone density test?

Healtchare guidelines recommend using fracture risk scores for screening and drug treatment decisions.
The timing of occurence of treatment-level (according to 2014 guidelines by an expert goup) or screening-level (according to 2011 guidelines by national experts) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women who finished their last menstrual cycle.
We conducted a risk analysis of new occurence of treatment- and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, before receiving drug treatment and hip or spine fracture.
In 54, 280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone hardness test, the time for 10% to get a treatment-level fracture risk score could not be estimated correctly due to rare amount of treatment-level scores.
In 6096 women who had fracture risk scores calculated with bone hardness, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level fracture risk ranged from 7.6 years for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years, for those aged 75 to 79 at the start.
Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level fracture risk score at the start, 100 (0.6%) had a hip or back fracture by age 65 years.
Postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at the start were unlikely to get a treatment-level fracture risk score between 50 and 64 years.
After age 65, the increased amount of treatment-level fracture risk scores, bone weakening, and major fractures from bone weakening support more frequent consideration of fracture risk and bone hardness testing.
