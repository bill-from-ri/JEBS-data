How often should i have a bone density test?

Guidelines for patient care recommend use of fracture risk scores, or the likelihood of having a major bone break, for checks and drug treatment decisions.
The timing of treatment-level or screening-level fracture risk scores based on guidelines has not been estimated in women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period).
We measured new occurences of teratment-level and testing-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, before receiving drug treatment and the first hip or clinical vertebral fracture.
In 54,280 women who had gone through menopause aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, we could not estimate the time for 10% to need treatment based on a common osteoporosis questionnaire due to too few scores suggesting treatment.
In 6096 women who had scores from a common osteoporosis questionnaire, the estimated time to need treatment was 7.6 years and 5.1 years for those aged 65 to 69 and aged 75 to 79, respectively.
Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with an initial screening-level FRAX (or fracture-risk score), 100 (0.6%) broke their hip or spine by age 65 years.
We conclude that women who have gone through menopause with questionnaire scores that did not suggest treatment were unlikely to have a score suggesting treatment between ages 50 and 64 years.
After age 65, questionnaire scores suggesting treatment, osteoporosis, and serious bone breaks due to osteoporosis suggest doing more questionnaires and bone mineral density testing more often.
