How to eliminate nocturnal atrial fibrillation?

The normal sleep-wake cycle (our-24 hour daily sleep pattern) is characterized by fluctuations in the day and variations at night in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac events (reduced blood flow that may damage the heart).
Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Sleep apnea disrupts the normal patterns between sleep and how the heart functions, and the physical changes vary for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by airflow blockage, and central sleep apnea (CSA), when breathing regularly stops while sleeping because the brain doesn't tell the muscles to take in air.
There are associations between sleep-disordered breathing, including OSA and CSA, and heart failure, atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots) and other heart problems.
Treatment options include positive airway pressure (a machine used to pump air under pressure into the airway of the lungs), adaptive servo-ventilation (a device that tracks and adjusts its pressure to match the breathing pattern of a person with sleep apnea), and phrenic nerve stimulation (treatment that sends electrical stimulation to the patient's phrenic nerve to contract the diaphragm and produce breathing).
Treatment improves blood pressure, quality of life, and sleepiness.
Results from clinical trials are not definite in how they affected common cardiovascular diseases.
