How to eliminate nocturnal atrial fibrillation?

Nighttime onset of atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) is sometimes associated with obstructive sleep apnea (where muscles in the throat relax, the airway is narrowed or closed, and breathing is momentarily cut off) along with a specific heart rate pattern called cyclical variation.
This study determines whether cyclical variation of heart rate is common in patients with nighttime atrial fibrillation (AF).
There are 34 patients in the study with paroxysmal AF (when the heart rate returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment), including 14 patients with daytime AF and 20 patients with nighttime AF.
The presence of cyclical variation in heart rate is examined, and the heart rate differences are measured and counted 40 minutes before each AF episode.
Cyclical variation in heart rate is found in 12 of 20 (60%) nighttime episodes and only in two of 14 (14%) daytime episodes.
Cyclical variation in heart rate was much greater in the nighttime AF than in daytime AF episodes.



The high presence of cyclical variation in heart rate found before nighttime atrial fibrillation episodes suggests that sleep apnea may play a role in the onset of nighttime atrial fibrillation.
