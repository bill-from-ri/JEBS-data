Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

This study examined patients after embryo transfer. This study aimed to predict the influence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) levels on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery.
This study evaluated 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET (lab-grown egg transfer) treatment.
The influence of other factors on finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss was determined. These factors included age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation. This study also aimed to predict if multiple pregnancy was related to hCG value.
The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs).
Because of this, the data was evaluated in several levels.
The data was analyzed through several statistical algorithms.
The hCG level grew more and more rapidly in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET).
Probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation grows with increased hCG values on the day of the draw.
The hCG value determined what type of pregnancy would occur.
The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values above the average. However, below-average hCG values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy.
Patients age was not proven to be of significant influence. The hCG level slightly decreased with higher age.
An increase in frequency of abortions correlating (linking) to increased age of the mother was once again confirmed.
The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result. Because of this, hCG value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.
