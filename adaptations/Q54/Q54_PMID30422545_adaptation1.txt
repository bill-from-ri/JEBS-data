Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is a chemical created by trophoblast tissue. Trophoblast tissue is typically found in early embryos. Trophoblast tissue will eventually be part of the placenta.
Measuring hCG levels can be helpful in identifying a normal pregnancy and a pathologic (abnormal) pregnancy, and can also be useful following an aborted pregnancy.
There is also a benefit in measuring hCG in a variety of cancers. This includes choriocarcinoma (tumors in the uterus) and extra-uterine (outer-womb) malignancies.
