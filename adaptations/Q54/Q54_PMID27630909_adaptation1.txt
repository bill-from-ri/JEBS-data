Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Signs of Ectopic (outer-uterus or outer-womb) Pregnancy (EP) can be highly variable. Serum Beta hCG (a pregnancy hormone) estimation plays an important role in early diagnosis.
The aim of the study was to determine trends of hCG levels in EP. This study also aimed to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs.
A study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care center in southern India was carried out.
These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol.
The study identified 337 women with EP.
Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml.
Among women who had Beta hCG estimations 48 hours apart, plateauing was observed in 22.5% while decreased levels were noted in 26.8%.
Almost half of the cases had an increase in levels. Less than 3% demonstrated an initial fall followed by a rise in titers (concentration).
In 23.9%, there was a rise >53% similar to intrauterine (normal) pregnancy.
The average pre-treatment Beta hCG was 429.8, 3866.2 and 12961.5 mIU/ml for those who received expectant, medical and direct surgical treatment, respectively.
Forty-three women with relative contraindications (unable to take certain treatments) received medical management. Thirty-nine women were lost to follow-up after medical and expectant management.
Excluding these women, the success rates of these two modalities (treatments) were 76.6% and 85.0% respectively.
No single level of Beta hCG is diagnostic of EP. However, serial (multiple) levels can demonstrate atypical trends in some cases.
Therefore, interpretation of these results should be done with clinical and ultrasound evaluations to arrive at a correct diagnosis.
