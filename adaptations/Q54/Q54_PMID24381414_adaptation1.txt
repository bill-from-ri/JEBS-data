Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

The first trimester screening program offers a noninvasive (nonsurgical) option for the early detection of aneuploidy pregnancies. Aneuploidy refers to the conditions of having an abnormal number of chromosomes.
This screening is done by evaluating serum (blood) free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free β-hCG - a preganancy hormone), pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), maternal age, and fetal nuchal translucency (NT - area of tissue at the back of an unborn baby's neck) thickness at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation.
A beneficial consequence of screening is the early diagnosis of chromosomal anomalies.
At 11 to 13 weeks, the relative prevalence of chromosomal anomalies are found to be 1:3 and 1:7, respectively.
Chromosomal anomalies are associated with increased maternal age, increased fetal NT, and decreased PAPP-A. However, in a specific chromosomal anomalies, known as trisomy 21, serum free β-hCG is increased. In trisomies 18 and 13, various types of chromosomal anomalies, free β-hCG is decreased.
