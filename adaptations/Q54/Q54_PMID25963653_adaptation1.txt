Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a pregnancy hormone. The hormone is secreted by the outermost layer of the placenta. The hormone has been linked to fetal growth and various placental, uterine, and fetal functions.
To investigate the effects of hCG on clinical endpoints, having knowledge on reference range (RR) methodology and determinants of gestational hCG levels is crucial.
Also, a better understanding of gestational hCG function can improve current screening programs and future clinical management.
Serum (blood) hCG levels were determined in 8195 women.
Gestational age specific RRs using 'ultrasound derived gestational age' (US RRs) were calculated. This data was compared with 'last menstrual period derived gestational age' (LMP RRs) and a model-based RR.
The study also investigated which pregnancy characteristics were associated with hCG levels.
Compared to the US RRs, the LMP RRs were lower.
No considerable differences were found between RRs calculated in the general population or in uncomplicated pregnancies only.
Maternal smoking, BMI, monetary income, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight, and vomiting associated with pregnancy were correlated with total hCG.
This study provides gestational RRs for total hCG. Additionally, this study shows total hCG values and RR cut-offs during pregnancy vary depending on pregnancy dating methodology.
This is likely due to the influence of hCG on embryonic growth. This suggests that ultrasound based pregnancy dating might be less reliable in women with high/low hCG levels.
Furthermore, this study identifies different pregnancy characteristics that influence total hCG levels. These pregnancy characteristics should therefore be accounted for in clinical studies.
