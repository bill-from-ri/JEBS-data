Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved both in immune system monitoring or regulation and infection-fighting processes such as inflammation.
In particular, within the PUFAs category, omega-3 (ω-3) may reduce inflammation, whereas omega-6 (ω-6) PUFAs are generally considered to have an inflammatory effect.
Recent evidence shows an imbalance in the ω-3:ω-6 ratio with an increased intake of ω-6, as a result of the shift towards a westernized diet.
In important age groups such as infants, toddlers and young children, as well as pregnant and milk-giving women or fish allergic patients, ω-3 intake may be improper.
This article aims to discuss the potential beneficial effects of PUFAs on child-related food allergy prevention and treatment, both at pre-birth and post-birth ages.
Data from preclinical studies with PUFAs supplementation show encouraging effects in reducing allergic response.
Medical study results are still conflicting about the best timing and amounts of supplementation and which individuals are most likely to benefit. Therefore, it is still not possible to draw firm conclusions.
Regarding food-allergic children, it is still argued whether PUFAs could slow disease worsening or not, since consistent data are lacking.
In conclusion, more data on the effects of ω-3 PUFAs supplementation alone or in combination with other nutrients are needed, both in the general and food allergic population.
