Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Background: Atopic dermatitis is a common childhood disease, potentially influenced by prenatal nutritional exposures such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
Objective: In a racially diverse cohort, we hypothesized that childhood atopic dermatitis would be associated with higher prenatal omega-6 (n-6) and lower omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs.
Methods: We included mother-child dyads, births 2006 to 2011, enrolled in the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development in Early Childhood cohort.
Primary exposures included second trimester plasma n-3 and n-6 PUFA status and the ratio of the two (n-6:n-3).
We assessed child current atopic dermatitis symptoms in the previous 12 months at age approximately 4 to 6 years.
We investigated the association between PUFA exposures and atopic dermatitis using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
We assessed for effect modification by maternal prenatal smoking, atopic disease history, and child sex.
Results: Among 1131 women, 67% were African American and 42% had an atopic disease history; 17% of children had atopic dermatitis.
Higher prenatal n-6 PUFAs were associated with increased relative odds of child atopic dermatitis (adjusted odds ratio: 1.25; confidence interval: 1.01-1.54 per interquartile range difference), and interaction models demonstrated that this association was seen in dyads in which the women had a history of atopic disease.
Neither prenatal n-3 PUFAs nor n-6:n-3 were associated with child atopic dermatitis.
Conclusion: In this racially diverse cohort, higher second trimester n-6 PUFAs were associated with atopic dermatitis in children of women with atopy.
PUFAs may represent a modifiable risk factor for atopic dermatitis, particularly in individuals with a familial predisposition.
