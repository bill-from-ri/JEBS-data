Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Elevated inflammatory cytokines and chronic pain are associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a measure of cellular aging.
Micronutrients, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) and omega 3, have anti-inflammatory properties.
Little is known regarding the relationships between vitamin D, omega 6:3 ratio, LTL, inflammation, and chronic pain.
We investigate associations between vitamin D, omega 6:3 ratio, LTL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in people living with/without chronic pain overall and stratified by chronic pain status.
A cross-sectional analysis of 402 individuals (63% women, 79.5% with chronic pain) was completed.
Demographic and health information was collected.
Chronic pain was assessed as pain experienced for at least three months.
LTL was measured in genomic DNA isolated from blood leukocytes, and micronutrients and CRP were measured in serum samples.
Data were analyzed with general linear regression.
Although an association between the continuous micronutrients and LTL was not observed, a positive association between omega 6:3 ratio and CRP was detected.
In individuals with chronic pain, based on clinical categories, significant associations between vitamin D, omega 6:3 ratio, and CRP were observed.
Findings highlight the complex relationships between anti-inflammatory micronutrients, inflammation, cellular aging, and chronic pain.
