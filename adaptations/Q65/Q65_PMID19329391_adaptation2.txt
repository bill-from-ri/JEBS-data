Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

There is evidence that changes in blood fatty acid make-up may play a role in certain brain disorders.
This patient study was conducted to test the link between blood fatty acid levels and mental retardation in Korean children.
Blood fatty acids, blood fat levels, dietary fatty acids and selected nutrients were measured in 31 mentally retarded boys (average age 9.93 +/-1.5 yrs) and normal boys.
Total blood omega-3 fatty acids (Sigmaw3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; specific omega-3 fatty acids) and high density lipoprotein (HDL - good cholesterol) concentrations were much lower. The Sigmaomega-6/Sigmaomega-3 ratio was much higher in affectedpatients than in normal patients.
The odds in favor of mental retardation increased by 69 % for each unit increase in the Sigmaomega-6/ Sigmaomega-3 ratio.
Significant variation in blood Sigmaomega-3 and the Sigmaomega-6/ Sigmaomega-3 ratio was explained by mental retardation and blood HDL concentrations (45% and 37 % respectively).
There was a significant opposite link between blood DHA and mental retardation. As one goes up, the other goes down.
For each unit increase in blood DHA, odds of mental retardation decreased by 74 %.
There was no significant difference in either total dietary fat or fatty acids intakes between affected patients and normal patients.
The energy intake of affected patients was significantly higher than the healthy patients.
These results suggest that amount of plasma Sigmaomega-3 fatty acids, particularly, DHA, and the Sigmaomega-6/ Sigmaomega-3 ratio are linked with mental retardation in children in this study.
