How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

Vitamin D plays a key role in controlling blood pressure and fluid in the body and is used by SARS-CoV-2, the virus leading to the respiratory disease of COVID-19, for entry into cells.
Vitamin D controls several processes of the immune system to minimize the virus. Examples include preventing entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19), reducing inflammation (the body's response to infection causing swelling, pain, or redness), and increasing the production of natural defensive cells in the body that could destroy SARS-CoV-2.
