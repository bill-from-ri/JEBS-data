How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) may cause diseases such as pneumonia (lung infection), heart-related changes, and multiple organ failure, which has been related to cytokine storm (an immune reaction where the body releases too many cytokines, which play a role in the body's normal immune response, into the blood too quickly), a systematic inflammatory response (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues), and an attack by the immune system.
Also, an oxidative stress imbalance, which can lead to cell and tissue damage, has been shown to occur in COVID-19 patients.
N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is used to build antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells), and its presence may be followed by reduced, or charged, glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant that protects tissues and cells.
NAC may be a potential preventive drug for a variety of disorders that involve GSH depletion and oxidative stress.
At very high doses, N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is also used as a medicine against paracetamol intoxication (too much of a common oral medication called Acetaminophen used for pain and reducing fevers).
NAC may help prevent SARS-CoV-2, the virus leading to COVID-19, from entering cells.
NAC taken orally (by mouth) is likely to weaken the risk of developing COVID-19.
Also, high-does N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) taken intravenously (medication delivered through the vein) may play a role in expanding the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases and help control lung and heart complications.
