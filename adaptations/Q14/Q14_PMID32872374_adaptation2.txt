How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

A new coronavirus, COVID-19 (a viral respiratory disease), is causing global death and lockdown burdens.
A faulty immune system is a known risk factor for all viral influenza infections.
Certain foods improve the immune system's ability to prevent and control harmful viral infections, while physical activity improves such protective benefits.
Exercise improves general and antibody-related immune systems through immediate, temporary, and long-term changes to physical activity in a proportional relationship.
Prevention of non-infectious disease by certain foods can lead to protection against breathing-related viral infections and COVID-19.
Certain foods and supplements in popular diets have immune-boosting molecules.
Foods with antiviral properties include fruits, vegetables, fermented foods, probiotics, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, amino acids, and protein units.
Regular moderate exercise may reduce viral risk and improve sleep quality during quarantine, along with appropriate diet and foods.
Lifestyle and appropriate diet may offer further antiviral approaches for public health.
