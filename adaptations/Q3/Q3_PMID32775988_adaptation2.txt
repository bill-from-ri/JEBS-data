How can i reduce my potassium levels?

In patients with full-body-spreading, chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney deterioration leads to higher risk of high blood potassium.
Medications that block kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes worsen high blood potassium risk, especially in those with long-lasting kidney disease.
When high blood potassium develops, clinicians recommend a lower-potassium diet.
This work explores hurdles to continuing a low-potassium diet and its effects on harmful medical outcomes.
A potassium-rich diet may have multiple health benefits due to other vitamin, mineral, and fiber content in the foods.
These benefits include blood pressure reductions and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.
High-potassium foods may also reduce progression of and risk of death from chronic kidney disease.
Supporting treatment with new potassium-binding agents, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may allow kidney-affecting medication and a less-restricted diet in patients with chronic kidney disease and high blood potassium.
New potassium-binding agents may allow the benefits of a high-potassium diet without risk of higher blood potassium. However, more studies are needed.
