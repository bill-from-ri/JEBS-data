Hypokalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is less than normal. Potassium is a very important mineral in the body. Hypokalemia rarely happens in healthy people. It happens commonly In patients in the hospital, on diuretics, or with heart and circulation conditions.
Hypokalemia can happen without patients noticing anything wrong. Older adult more commonly notice some effect (symptom) of hypokalemia.
Common effects (symptoms) of hypokalemia are abnormal heart beats and muscle weakness or pain.
Doctors treat hypokalemia with IV potassium while monitoring the heart  in patients who have significant symptoms, EKG problems, or severe hypokalemia.
Doctors treat hypokalemia with potassium by mouth in patients without symptoms or if the hypokalemia is less severe.
Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Hyperkalemia can also cause abnormal heart beats and muscle symptoms.
Doctors must treat hyperkalemia right away if the blood potassium levels are too high, if EKG changes occur (no matter what the blood potassium levels are), or if severe muscle symptoms occur.
This urgent treatment includes IV calcium, IV insulin, and medicines given by an inhalers (called beta-agonists).
Kidney dialysis can be used in urgent situations
For patients with less severe hyperkalemia, sometimes medicines are used that can get rid of the excess potassium through the kidneys or the  bowels.
