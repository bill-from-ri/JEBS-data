How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is a very important mineral (electrolyte) in the body. Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder. It more likely occurs when the body cannot get rid of potassium as well as it should.
Hyperkalemia can lead to serious problems. Especially because hyperkalemia can cause severe problems with the heart beat.
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Drugs that block the RAAS (RAAS blockers) have good effects on the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). But the RAAS blockers can cause hyperkalemia. High-potassium diets can also have good effects on the cardiovascular system. But doctors have to stop giving these RAAS blockers and also recommend low-potassium diets in patients with hyperkalemia.
Potassium can predict mortality. Potassium levels should be checked often in patients at risk for hyperkalemia.
The rules for treating hyperkalemia that occurs rapidly have been updated.
Patient studies have shown that the new drugs to treat hyperkalemia (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) work well to treat hyperkalemia.
These new drugs may let doctors continue to use the RAAS blockers more often. Doctors may be able to recommend less strict potassium diets too.
Hyperkalemia should be closely watched for in high-risk patients because it can lead to poor outcomes.
New drugs have been shown to work well. There is hope that these new drugs can control the blood potassium levels in patients that would benefit from RAAS blockers and diets higher in potassium, leading to better overall treatment results.
