How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular, ongoing (maintenance) dialysis have a high risk of developing hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is defined as a potassium level in the blood that is higher than normal.
Currently, the main treatments of hyperkalemia in patients with ESRD are dialysis, eating a diet low in potassium, and avoiding medicines that increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
In this paper, we focus on the issues and problems associated with the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients on maintenance dialysis. We present a case to illustrate these issues.
We also discuss potential treatments, other than dialysis, for these patients. Newer drugs , such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate bind to potassium. These potassium-binding drugs may reduce the need for the very strict dialysis diet. Because the dialysis diet is very strict, there may be problems getting enough nutrition for patients with ESRD. These potassium-binding drugs may also reduce the risk of potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia.
