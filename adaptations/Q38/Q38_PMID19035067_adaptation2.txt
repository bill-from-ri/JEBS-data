How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

A pressure ulcer (bedsore) is a area-limited injury to the skin and neaby body parts, usually over a bone, due to unrelieved pressure.
Risk factors can be intrinsic (e.g., limited movement, poor diet, other diseases, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g, pressure, friction, strain, moisure).
Prevention includes identifying at-risk people and applying preventative measures, like regularly moving the patient's position, keeping the bed head low to prevent strain, using pressure-reducing surfaces, evaluating diet and giving diet supplemets, if needed.
When an ulcer occurs, examining it (i.e., size, location, type of affected tissue, leaking fluid, odor, wound openings, wear and tea, and infection) and the severity of the ulcer are essential to wound assessment.
Treatment includes managing nearby and far-away infetions, removing dead body tissue, maintaining a moist environment for wound healing, and even surgery.
Removing damaged body tissue (debridement) is needed when dead tissue is present.
Urgent debridement should be done if bacterial skin infections develop.
Physical removal, use of a chemical topical, and natural forms of debridement are nonurgent treatments.
Wound cleaning, preferably with salt water and appropriate bandages, are common treatment for clean bedsores and after removing damaged body tissue.
Bacteria can be managed with cleaning.
Antibiotics applied skin-level should be considered if there is no healing after 14 days.
Full-body antibiotics are used in those with developing skin infections, inflammation, or full-body infection.
