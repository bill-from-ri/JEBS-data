How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

Pressure injury (PI) is used to describe skin damage not caused by underlying diseases. PI affects strength of the skin. PI is produced by prolonged pressure or friction between a hard internal and external surface.
Treatment can be challenging when there is no solution with usual clinical care.
The use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (APRP) gel is a possible therapeutic (medical) option for chronic pressure injuries. APRP uses injections of the patient's own platelets (blood cells) to increase healing rates.
The case of a patient with chronic PI who has been treated with APRP is presented, achieving resolution (healing) of the lesion (wound).
