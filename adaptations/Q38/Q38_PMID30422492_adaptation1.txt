How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

Wound pressure injuries (skin sores) have been given various names over the last several years.
In the past, they were referred to as pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers, or bed sores. Now, they are most commonly referred to as "pressure injuries."
Pressure injuries are the breakdown of skin integrity due to some types of unrelieved pressure.
Pressure injuries can come from a bony area on the body coming into contact with an external surface.
Pressure injuries represent the breakdown of normal structure and function of the skin and soft tissue. Soft tissue includes muscles, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons, and tissues surrounding bones and joints. Pressure injuries are formed through several different mechanisms and causes.
The wound healing process is affected by various factors. These factors include infection, the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, aging, nutritional deficiency like vitamin C, medications like steroids. Additionally, the would healing process can be affected by low rates of oxygen and blood flow to the wound in cases of hypoxia (low oxygen in tissues) and cold temperature.
Pressure ulcers result from long periods of repeated pressure applied to the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone.
In pressure ulcers, the external pressure exceeds capillary closing pressure. Capillary closing pressure is the minimal amount of pressure needed to collapse a blood vessel. When external pressure is greater than the capillary closing pressure, blood flow is impaired for an extended period of time.
