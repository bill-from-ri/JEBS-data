How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

Wound pressure injuries have various names over the last few years.
In the past, they were known as pressure ulvers, decubitus ulcers, or bed sores. Now, they are known as "pressure injuries".
Pressure injuries are the breakdown of skin due to some forms of constant pressure.
This can be from a bone coming in contact with an external surface like skin which leads to pressure injury.
These wounds are the destriction of normal structure and function of skin and nearby tissue through various physical processes and causes.
Healing the wound is affected by factors like infection, other long-lasting diseases like diabetes, aging, nutrient shortages like Vitamin C, medications like steroids, and low blood flow to the wound during periods of reduced oxygen and cold temperature.
Pressure ulcers come from extended, repeated pressure to the skin, nearby tissue, muscle, and bone.
In pressure ulcers, the outside pressure is greater than blood vessel closing pressure.
