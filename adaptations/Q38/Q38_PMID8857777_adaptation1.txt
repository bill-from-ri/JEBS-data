How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

The use of wound dressings based on moist wound healing principles has recently changed how pressure ulcers (skin sores) are treated. Moist wound healing is when an injury is kept damp to prevent drying out.
These products may improve healing rates. They may also offer improved comfort to the patient, reduced dressing time, and improved wound appearance.
However, healing is unlikely to occur unless the reasons the ulcer was formed are addressed.
There are several principles of ulcer management or healing. These principles include: eliminating or reducing pressure and other contributing factors, treating infection, appropriate wound management, involvement and education of the patient and caregivers, and maintenance of healed tissue.
It is estimated that 95% of all pressure ulcers are preventable.
Preventing ulcers rather than treating ulcers is a priority in the effort to reduce the incidence (frequency) of this common, complex, and difficult problem.
Use of assessment (measurement) tools that identify the main reasons pressure ulcers are caused is helpful to predict and prevent injuries to the skin.
