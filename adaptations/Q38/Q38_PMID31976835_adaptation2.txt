How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

The recycability of pectin-based films (thin strips of plant-based fiber) is of interest in wound bandaging, due to its non-toxicity, acid-sensitivity, and gel-like nature.
One idea to improve the function, bioactive composition, and performance when wet of pectin-based films is mixing it with other biological molecules.
Our objective is to create waterproof films based on a pectin/starch blend with specific plant extracts that have controlled release of bioactive and healing substances.
The molecular composition of the waterproof films were measured with specific tools. We also measured the tension strength, water uptake, and bioactive molecules released in water.
The skin-related anti-inflammatory activity of the waterproof films was measured by testing its anti-inflammatory eactivity on an inflammed mouse ear.
We tested the healing effects of the active waterproof films with rats and human bedsores.
The films showed an acceptable water-uptake capacity between 100-160%.
The release of biological compounds from the waterproof films followed a standard drug-release trend.
The function of the waterproof films was not affected by the plant extracts within the amounts used.
Adding plant extracts into the films blocked the skin swelling by around 50%.
The application of the active waterproof film on the surface of the bedsore is closed after 17 days without any side effects.
A new waterproof film was created from a starch-pectin blend, with suitable chemical-physical properties to carry plant extracts with wound healing effects.
