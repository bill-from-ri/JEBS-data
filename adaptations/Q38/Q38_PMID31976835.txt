How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

Background: The biodegradable and biocompatible nature of pectin-based films is of particular interest in wound dressing applications, due to its non-toxicity, pH-sensitivity and gelling activity.
An approach to improve the mechanical properties, the release profile of bioactive compounds as well as the performance in wet environments of pectin-based films is mixing with other biopolymers.
Objective: To prepare hydrocolloid films based on crosslinked pectin / starch blend loaded with bioactive extracts from leaves of G. tinctoria and U. molinae with controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing property.
Methods: The hydrocolloid films were characterized by FTIR, SEM, and TGA-FTIR techniques and their tensile properties, water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in aqueous media were evaluated.
The dermal anti inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed by the mouse ear inflammation test.
The wound healing property of the loaded hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model and in a clinical trial (sacrum pressure ulcer).
Results: The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%.
The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation.
The mechanical properties of hydrocolloid films were not affected by the plant extracts within the concentration range used.
The incorporation of the bioactive extracts in the polysaccharide films inhibited the topical edematous response by about 50%.
The topical application of the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer is completely closed after 17 days without showing any adverse reaction.
Conclusion: A novel hydrocolloid matrix was produced from crosslinked starch-pectin, which exhibited suitable chemical-physical properties to be used as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.
