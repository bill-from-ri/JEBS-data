Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

Hair loss and thinning are possible side effects in those undergoing hormonal therapies with aromatase inhibitors (drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer).
Alopecia (hair loss and thinning) in young patients undergoing hormonal therapy has not been previously studied.
We describe two adolescents, 14 and 16 years of age, who got androgenetic alopecia (common hair loss or thinning) after receiving treatment with anastrozole (a durg usually used to treat breast cancer) for unusally short height.
Therefore, the possible side effect of alopecia should be considered in the young population undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors.
