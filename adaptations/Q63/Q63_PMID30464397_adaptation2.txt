Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

For background, anastrozole is an important drug ingredient for treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (BC) in women who have finished their last period.
However, treatment with the only available drug taken by mouth is linked with serious side effects that worsen with greater doses. These side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others.
In contrast, a steady release of anastrozole could minimize these serious side effects from the drug.
Anastrozole administered by a patch on the skin was created for efficient administration, avoiding drug crystals in the body, desired drug release, storage ease, easy handling, stability, and stickiness on the skin.
Continuous anastrozole treatment was studied in cells designed to measure the success of oils, creams, and gels.
Drug reactions in blood from the final anastrozole treatment on skin was tested in beagle dogs.
To analyze the drug, a specific filtration method was created and verified.
After enough drug exposure, a sustained 65% drug release from the skin treatment over 48 hours was obtained.
Data in living animals showed good anastrozole blood concentration overtime, avoiding the worst of side effects linked with treatment by mouth but matching its helpful blood levels up to 72 hours.
In conclusion, applying anastrozole by skin shows improved drug reactions and safety. The treatment is a promising option to treat human BC by reducing unwanted side effects.
