Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

For the study's background, while the frequency of alopecia (hair loss or thinning) to powerful chemotherapies (cancer-treating treatments) has been well described, the frequency of alopecia during hormonal therapies (i.e., anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors used to treat breast cancer) has not been described.
Hormonal agents are widely used in the treatment and prevention of many solid tumors, mainly those of the breast and prostrate.
Sticking to these therapies is not the best, In part due to toxicities.
We analyzed scientific papers to measure the frequency and risk for alopecia in patients receiving hormonal therapies.
Data from 19,430 patients in 35 clinical trials were available for analysis.
Of these, 13,415 patients got hormonal treatments. 6,015 did not.
The frequency of any alopecia ranged from 0% to 25%, with an overall frequency of 4.4%.
The highest frequency of any alopecia was seen in patients treated with tamoxifen (an estrogen-influencing drug) in a clinical trial (25.4%). Similarly, the overall frequency of severe alopecia in the analysis was highest with tamoxifen (6.4%).
The overall risk of alopecia compared with sham treatment was 12.88, with specific estrogen-receptor influencers having the highest risk.
In conclusion, alopecia is a common yet rarely-mentioned side effect of hormonal cancer therapies.
Their long-term use increases the importance of this condition on patients' quality of life.
These findings are important for pre-therapy counseling, identifying risk factors, and creating treatments that could improve sticking to the plan and lowering this emotionally difficult event.
