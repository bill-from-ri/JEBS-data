Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

For the study's purpose, increased skin-related or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression may promote breast cancer resistance to hormonal therapy.
We have studied if giving gefitinib, an EGFR blocker, first might overcome biologic and medical resistance to pre-treatment anastrozole (a drug commonly used for breast cancer) in a medical trial.
The study included postmenopausal women (women who had their last period) with hormone receptor-specific, early breast cancer received anastrozole 1 mg daily for 16 weeks. Then, they were randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:5:5 to also receive (1) gefitinib 250 mg/d by mouth for 16 weeks, (2) dummy treatment 1 tablet/d by mouth for 2 weeks and then gefitinib for 14 weeks, or (3) dummy treatment for 16 weeks.
The main measure was biologic change in cancer cell growth at 2 and 16 weeks. The main secondary measure was overall health improvement or objective response (OR).
For the study's results, two hundred six women were randomly assigned.
Average changes in cancer cell growth with anastrozole and gefitinib versus anastrozole alone were -77.4% and -83.6%, respectively, between start and 16 weeks, -80.1% and -71.3% between start and 2 weeks, and -19.3% and -43% between 2 and 16 weeks.
ORs in the 2-drug-group and anastrozole alone group were 48% and 61%, respectively, and 48% versus 72% in the female-sex-hormone-specific subgroup, which was  consistent with cancer cell growth changes.
Common treatment-related side effects included diarrhea, rash, alopecia (hair loss or thinning), dry skin, and nausea.
There was no evidence of a drug interaction.
In conclusion, adding gefitinib to pre-treatment anastrozole had no additional clinical or biologic effect, failing to support our original theory.
