Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

Hair loss and thinning are possible complications in those undergoing endocrine therapies with aromatase inhibitors.
Alopecia in pediatric patients undergoing endocrine therapy has not been previously reported.
We describe two adolescents, 14 and 16 years of age, who developed androgenetic alopecia following treatment with anastrozole for idiopathic short stature.
Accordingly, the possible adverse event of alopecia should be considered in the pediatric population undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors.
