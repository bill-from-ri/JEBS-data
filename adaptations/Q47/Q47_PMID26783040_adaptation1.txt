What causes low alkaline phosphate levels?

Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a sign of hypophosphatasia (genetic disease that affects bone and tooth development). ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength.
However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear.
To better understand this issue, the authors performed a study of 42 individuals with unexplained low ALP levels. The participants were between 20 to 77 years old.
Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia (high serum phosphate) and three had mild hypercalcemia (high blood calcium).
ALP levels were inversely related with serum calcium, pyridoxal phosphate, and urine phosphoethanolamine. These are all compounds within the body that play a role in bone health.
Many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild muscle or bone pain. However, none had major health problems.
Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects, including six novel mutations.
All but one were heterozygous mutations, which is a mutation only affecting one form of a gene.
Missense mutations, or mistakes in the DNA, were the most common. Most of the mutations were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity.
The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of serum (blood) ALP, higher levels of PLP and PEA, as well as mildly increased serum phosphate.
Ten individuals had PLP levels above the reference range. All carried a mutated allele or gene copy.
One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation.
In almost half of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate (cell substance) accumulation. This may make an individual more likely to experience defects in calcified tissues, such as bone.
