What causes low alkaline phosphate levels?

Background: Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) is an enzyme that assists in breaking down phosphate groups. Phosphate groups are important in activating proteins. TNSALP is encoded by a gene, known as ALPL, that is of particular importance for bone mineralization or when minerals deposit onto bone.
Mutation, or a structural change, in the ALPL gene can cause persistent low alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. Low ALP activity can result in the rare disease Hypophosphatasia (HPP). HPP is characterized by disturbed bone and dental or tooth mineralization.
Severe forms of HPP are extremely rare. However, there is an estimated prevalence of 1/100,000 people. Recent studies suggest that moderate HPP is more common with an estimated prevalence of 1/508 people.
The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low ALP levels in the population based on laboratory measurements.
The prevalence of low AP activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels was analyzed in 6,918,126 measurements from 2011 to 2016. PLP is a co-enzyme or helper in several body processes.
Only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included.
Only the first measurement was included. All repeated values were excluded.
In total, 8.46% of the measurements showed a value < 30 U/L. 0.59% of the subjects with an ALP activity below 30 U/L had an additional PLP measurement.
Of the participants, 6.09% showed elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels.
This suggest that 0.52% of subjects show signs of HPP.
These data support the estimation that the prevalence of moderate forms of HPP is higher than expected.
The authors recommend automatic measurement of PLP in cases of low ALP activity. Physicians should be notified that HPP should be included in the diagnosis and further exploration is recommended.
