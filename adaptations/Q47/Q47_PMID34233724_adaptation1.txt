What causes low alkaline phosphate levels?

Severe hypercalcemia, or too high calcium blood levels, is rare in newborns. Even though hypercalcemia often shows no symptoms, it may have important effects on overall health.
Hypophosphatemia is when the body has low levels of phosphorous. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing malnutrition while in the womb, blood infection, and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN). PN is when a mother is given nutrients through IV. Hypophosphatemia can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism.
It is debated if phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) should be given in the first week of life in preterm infants.
This study reports on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation (time in womb). The infant had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and long-term severe hypercalcemia due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. IUGR is when a baby does not grow to normal weight during pregnancy.
Hypercalcemia did not improve after excess water intake but responded to infusion of PO4.
Eventually, the infant experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia. This was likely worsened by infusion of albumin, a blood protein.
Following this, parathyroid hormone (PTH), which controls calcium and phosphorus in the blood, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which removes phosphate groups,  returned to normal levels.
Severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in newborns. However, doctors should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia.
Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.
