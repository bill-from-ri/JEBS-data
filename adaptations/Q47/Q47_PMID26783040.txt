What causes low alkaline phosphate levels?

Background: Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a hallmark of hypophosphatasia.
However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear.
Methods: In order to clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals (age range 20-77yr) with unexplained low ALP levels.
Results: Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia and three had mild hypercalcemia.
ALP levels were inversely correlated with serum calcium (r=-0.38, p=0.012), pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; r=-0.51, p=0.001) and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA; r=-0.49, p=0.001).
Although many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems.
Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six novel mutations.
All but one, were heterozygous mutations.
Missense mutations were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%) and the majority were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity.
The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss (48% versus 12%; p=0.04), slightly lower levels of serum ALP (p=0.002), higher levels of PLP (p<0.0001) and PEA (p<0.0001), as well as mildly increased serum phosphate (p=0.03).
Ten individuals (24%) had PLP levels above the reference range; all carried a mutated allele.
Conclusion: One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation.
Although the associated clinical manifestations are usually mild, in approximately 50% of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate accumulation and may predispose to defects in calcified tissues.
