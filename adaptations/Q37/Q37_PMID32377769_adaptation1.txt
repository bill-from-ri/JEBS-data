Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Pregabalin, a drug often used to treat nerve damage, abuse has become an emerging concern. The current study aimed to investigate nervous system (brain and spinal cord) damage caused by prolonged high-dose of pregabalin. This dose is similar to that used by addicts. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol, a type of Vitamin E, as a possible agent to help side effects.
The study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the body.
The study also assessed (measured) the expression of the cell death-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3.
Additional tests evaluating three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was completed. MAPKs are involved in biological pathways that direct cell response to mitogens, or things that induce cell division.
The study also evaluated oxidative stress which is an imbalance between production and accumulation of harmful oxygen reactive species.
Evaluations of the degenerated cortical neurons, nerve cells within the brain, were also preformed.
Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the signaling for cellular processes, reversed ratios of proteins needed for cell cycles, and induced oxidative stress.
It also diminished the release of neurotransmitters and increased the count of degenerated neurons.
Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the harmful effects induced by pregabalin.
Alpha tocopherol plays a role in reducing negative side effects induced by pregabalin. It also normalizes neurotransmitter levels, positively effects signaling pathways for cell function, and improves cortical (brain) structure changes. These reasons make alpha tocopherol a promising therapeutic option in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy.
