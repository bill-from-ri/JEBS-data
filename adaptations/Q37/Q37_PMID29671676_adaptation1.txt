Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

A study investigated the effects of gabapentinoids, drugs often used to prevent and control seizures. The tested drugs include gabapentin, pregabalin and gastroretentive gabapentin. The study evaluated the effects of the drugs on simulated driving performance, sedation (relaxation) and cognitive function (thinking ability). The study was conducted in 32 healthy volunteers.
Driving attentiveness, sleepiness, and cognition were evaluated prior to treatment within participants.
Blood samples were collected during each treatment.
Subjects receiving gastroretentive gabapentin showed less change in variation (differences) in lateral (side) lane position, less tremors (shaking), and fewer vision disturbances compared with gabapentin.
Statistically significant decreases in One Card Learning Test (a test used to test short term memory) performance was observed after treatment with gastroretentive gabapentin.
The study concluded gastroretentive gabapentin reduced driving impairment and showed lower scores on key neurotoxicity (abnormal nervous system function) measures.
Further studies in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (nerve-related pain from shingles) are needed.
