Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Antiepileptic - or antiseizure - drugs (AEDs) can be associated with neurotoxic (brain damaging) side effects including cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive dysfunction or inability to think properly is a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment.
Pregabalin is a relatively new AED widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain, including fibromyalgia - full-body pain.
We measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin administration (use) in healthy volunteers.
Thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: pregabalin or sham treatment/placebo (1:1).
Pregabalin dose was continuously increased over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d.
Before treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing.
Test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were Z scored against test-retest scores taken from 90 healthy volunteers. Z scores determine how far a data point is away from a dataset average.
Z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared.
Thirty subjects completed the study (94%).
Three of 6 cognitive measures revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin.
These cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the Portland Neurotoxicity Scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity.
At standard doses and titration, pregabalin led to mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers.
These effects are one factor to be considered in the selection and monitoring of chronic AED therapy.
This study provides evidence that pregabalin 300 mg negatively impacts cognition on some tasks in healthy volunteers.
