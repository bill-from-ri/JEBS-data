Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

A 74-year-old man showed nerve damage due to diabetes (a disease involving high blood sugar). The patient had ingested 450 mg of pregabalin (PBG - a nerve pain medication) over a period of 8 hours which was followed by altered mental status.
A bedside test for brain activity was performed to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or a prolonged seizure. The test showed continuous triphasic waves (TWs), which is abnormal body activity, with slow background activity.
The patient recovered after 48 hours of stopping PBG. A repeated brain acitivty test after 72 hours did not show any TWs.
This study presents a rare case of PBG-induced TWs. This paper highlighting the extent of the etiologic spectrum of TWs, or how TWs promote disease. Additionally, the paper discusses the literature related to this association (or link).
