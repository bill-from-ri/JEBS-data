Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Central nervous system adverse effects are commonly reported with pregabalin (PGB).
On the other hand, movement disorders (MDs) associated with this drug were rarely described.
However, their occurrence could significantly affect the quality of life of PGB users.
This literature review aims to evaluate the clinical epidemiological profile, pathological mechanisms, and management of PGB-associated MDs.
Relevant reports in six databases were identified and assessed by two reviewers without language restriction.
A total of 46 reports containing 305 cases from 17 countries were assessed.
The MDs encountered were as follows: 184 individuals with ataxia, 61 with tremors, 39 with myoclonus, 8 with parkinsonism, 1 with restless legs syndrome, 1 with dystonia, 1 with dyskinesia, and 1 with akathisia.
The mean age was 62 years (range: 23-94).
The male sex was slightly predominant with 54.34%.
The mean PGB dose when the MD occurred was 238 mg, and neuropathic pain was the most common indication of PGB.
The time from PGB start to MD was < 1 month at 75%.
The time from PGB withdrawal to recovery was < 1 week at 77%.
All the individuals where the follow-up was reported had a full recovery.
The most common management was PGB withdrawal.
In the literature, the majority of the cases did not report information about timeline events, neurological examination details, or electrodiagnostic studies.
The best management for all MDs is probably PGB withdrawal.
If the patient is on dialysis program, perhaps an increased number of sessions will decrease recovery time.
Furthermore, the addition of a benzodiazepine could accelerate recovery.
