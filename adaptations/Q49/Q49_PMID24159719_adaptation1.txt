What causes pitted edema in legs?

Leg swelling in both legs over time is common, and in most cases unharmful, and is mostly found in the older population, especially in women.
Veins in the lower limbs that do not allow enough blood to flow to the heart, called venous insufficiency, is the most common cause of swelling in legs among those over the age of 50.
Diseases of the important organs such as the heart, the liver and the kidneys are excluded during the first stage.
Pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, occurs both in venous insufficiency and in right-sided heart failure.
Basic tests and drug history are usually enough to exclude a number of general causes of the edema.
