What causes pitted edema in legs?

Edema is a buildup of fluid in the body that occurs as the filtration rate exceeds the drainage rate, producing noticeable symptoms.
The rapid development of swelling linked with full-body disease needs timely identification and treatment.
The long-lasting buildup of fluid in one or both legs often indicates blood vessel impairment, especially in the presence of swelling in the limbs and iron buildup.
Skin care is needed in preventing skin breakdown and vein-related open sores.
Skin inflammation from swelling in the legs can be managed with specific moisturizers and steroid creams.
Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis (deep vein blood clotting) should wear compression socks to prevent its symptoms like pain and swelling.
If clinicians remain suspicious of deep venous thrombosis even when lab tests do not detect it, further lab tests may be performed to rule out other forms of blood clotting and compression.
Obstructuve sleep apnea (disorder in which breathing is consistently interrupted during sleep by a blockage) may cause swelling in both legs even without lung-related high blood pressure.
Sturdy skin with swelling characterizes lymphedema (fluid buildup when the body's drainage system is blocked), which can present in one or both legs.
Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, blunt force, previous hip surgery, lymph node (immune system organ) removal, and previous radiation therapy.
Use of compression devices to prevent blood clotting or socks may be helpful in these cases.
