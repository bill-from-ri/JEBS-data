What causes pitted edema in legs?

Rheumatologists are increasingly aware of the entity synovitis with pitting edema.
The remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome has been reported with an array of conditions that include polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome and psoriatic arthropathy.
Synovitis with pitting edema is now being increasingly recognized with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
We report a patient who presented with edema of hands and feet and was diagnosed eventually with definite SLE.
With magnetic resonance imaging, joint effusions and tenosynovitis were confirmed to be associated with the otherwise-unexplained extremity edema.
