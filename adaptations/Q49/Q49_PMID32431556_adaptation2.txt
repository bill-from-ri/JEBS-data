What causes pitted edema in legs?

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a condition in which the main right leg blood vessel compresses the main left leg blood vessel.
MTS puts the patient at risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), or deep blood clotting.
We describe a 30-year-old female who arrived at the emergency department with worsening left leg swelling for four weeks, with low-risk chance for DVT.
Exams showed left leg swelling with serious swelling up to the knee.
Her lower leg calf muscle was tender to touch.
Various blood vessel pulsations in the leg were noticeable due to the swelling. However, the rest of her pulsations were examined by touch.
Therefore, the identification of possibly DVT was made. Further invesetigations were requested.
We present this case to highlight the symptoms of May-Thurner syndrome, its identification, and treatment.
