What causes pitted edema in legs?

Specialists who treat diseases in the joints, muscles, and bones, called rheumatologists, are increasingly aware of swollen joints (synovitis) with pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation.
The remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome is a rare disease with swollen joints and pitting edema. RS3PE has been reported with a number of conditions that include polymyalgia rheumatica (a disorder that causes muscle pain and stiffness, mainly in the shoulders and hips), rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis whereby immune cells attack healthy cells), an immune system disorder that causes dry eyes and mouth called Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and a type of arthritis linked to psoriasis (a skin disease causing red, itchy scaly patches).
Synovitis with pitting edema is now being increasingly seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a chronic disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues.
Researchers report a patient who presented with edema (swelling) of hands and feet and was diagnosed eventually with definite lupus.
With imaging tools, fluid build up in the joints and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) of the top layer of tendons (tenosynovitis) were confirmed to be associated with the otherwise-unexplained edema in the limbs.
