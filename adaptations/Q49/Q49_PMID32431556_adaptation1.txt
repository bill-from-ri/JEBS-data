What causes pitted edema in legs?

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a clinical condition where the left iliac vein located in the abdomen that goes into the left leg is compressed by the right iliac artery which is a vein that goes into the right leg.
Having this condition makes it easier for the patient to develop deep venous thrombosis (DVT), a serious condition where a blood clot forms in the vein.
Researchers present the case of a 30-yearï»¿-old female who arrived at the emergency room with gradual left leg swelling for four weeks, with low-risk for developing DVT.
An exam revealed left leg swelling with pitting edema up to the knee, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation.
Her calf muscle was tender to light touch.
Veins in the foot, in the leg called the anterior tibial, and in the lower leg can be fairly felt due to the edema; however, the rest of her pulses were appropriately felt.
Therefore, the early diagnosis of possible DVT was made, and further investigations were requested.
Researchers present this case intending to highlight the clinical signs and symptoms of May-Thurner syndrome, its diagnosis, and treatment.
