How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents, is when the body cannot properly turn food into energy and can cause intellectual disability.
Observable PKU symptoms vary, due to nature, the changes in the gene for the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase protein which converts L-phenylalanine to energy, and nurture, the amount of L-phenylalanine eaten.
The history of PKU provides a lot of information including a way to grasp how complicated the disease is and where observable symptoms depend on both gene location and makeup.
This information is now being used to come up with treatments designed for an individual patient.
