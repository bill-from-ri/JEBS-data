How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inheritable disorder, is an inborn (i.e, existing from birth) error of metabolism that can lead to impaired cognitive development.
The physical effects of PKU come from nature, with DNA mutations in a gene that makes a certain protein, and nurture, with the protein L-phenylalanine in food.
PKU demonstrates the complexity of a disease where physical traits reflect genetic components.
Patient-specific therapies are being developed for diseases like PKU.
