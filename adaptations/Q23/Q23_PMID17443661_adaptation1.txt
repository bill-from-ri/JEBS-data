How is phenylketonuria inherited?

"Inborn errors of metabolism," or inherited disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy, first seen by a doctor 100 years ago, were important support for the idea that people have different chemical and biological makeups.
Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents, was discovered in 1934 by a doctor.
It causes intellectual disability from damage to the brain caused by too much phenylalanine in the blood.
Observable PKU symptoms vary due to nurture, where normal foods contain L-phenylalanine, and in nature, where many changes happen in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that controls the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase protein, which helps convert phenylalanine into energy.
The PAH protein converts phenylalanine, one molecule, to tyrosine, another molecule.
Through checks for conditions that affect newborns, PKU is one of the first inherited diseases to be prevented in the community with successful treatments.
Successful treatments caused a change in thinking about inherited disease.
The history of PKU provides a lot of information including a way to grasp how complicated the disease is and where observable symptoms depend on both gene location and makeup; what the human PAH gene tells us about the genetics and evolution of humans; and how our understanding of PKU is helped by a database on where gene changes happen.
Observable PKU symptoms have no "simple" or single explanation; every patient is different and will be treated at an individual level.
PKU knowledge shows that genes play a role in both disease and health.
