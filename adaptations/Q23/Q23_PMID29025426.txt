How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused by deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine.
If left untreated, PKU results in increased phenylalanine concentrations in blood and brain, which cause severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems.
PKU management differs widely across Europe and therefore these guidelines have been developed aiming to optimize and standardize PKU care.
