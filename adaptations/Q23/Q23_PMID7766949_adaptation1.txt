How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents caused by many changes at the location of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) protein. It is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy because it cannot process a molecule (phenylalanine).
One of the main questions scientists still have is why PKU happens in roughly 1 in 10,000 white people at any point in time.
More and more studies have suggested that both the high amount of the population with PKU at any point in time and the strong gene changes that go with this set of changes and variations might show more than one group of people in which PKU first developed.
We will show populations thought to be where PKU first developed in both Europe and Asia.
Some PAH changes go with many sets of gene variations, suggesting these changes happen more than once.
We will discuss information that supports and rejects these changes happening more than once, causing one change to happen in two sets of gene changes.
