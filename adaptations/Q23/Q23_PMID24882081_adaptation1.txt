How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Checks for conditions that affect newborns make finding individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn a substance (phenylalanine) into energy, easy and effective.
A recent drug treatment option brought fast development of a lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules that may be a sign of a disease.
However, genetic alternations that cause PKU do not equally reduce protein activity.
A range of over 850 genetic alterations causes elevated phenylalanine blood levels from very mild with no treatment to severe PKU, which needs immediate treatment.
Databases of physical gene locations and alterations carried in a gene allow effective classification and treatment of patients.
The lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules determines a patient's genetic alterations in a few days, especially if each lab comes up with a test to look for alterations in more than one gene for the most common alterations in a group of people.
