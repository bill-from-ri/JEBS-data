How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency or shortage) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy because it cannot process a molecule (phenylalanine). Very high phenylalanine levels damage the brain.
If not treated, the damage to the brain causes serious intellectual disability, a seizure disorder, and behavioral problems.
The part of the population who has PKU at a given point in time varies worldwide, with an average of about 1 in 10,000 newborns.
Early diagnosis is based on checks for conditions that affect newborns, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is usually normal with some decreased mental function.
Low-phenylalanine diets have been the go-to treatment for over 60 years and have worked, although results could be better and patients have trouble following the diets.
Drugs are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which only works in a small number of patients (usually with milder PKU), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily shots and causes harmful effects of the body's defense system.
Given the drawbacks and disadvantages of these treatments, other treatments are being developed, such as enabling the body to produce PAH proteins and replacing problematic genes with healthy ones.
Even though not enough PAH is the most common molecular (amino acid) metabolism disorder, damage of the brain in people with PKU is not well understood, and more research is needed to develop treatments.
