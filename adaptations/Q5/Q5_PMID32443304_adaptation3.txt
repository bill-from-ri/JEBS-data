How to treat a bakers cyst?

 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. There is a lack of research comparing the clinical effects of arthroscopic (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) treatment of popliteal cysts between the one posteromedial portal (OPP) technique, where one small hole, or portal, is made in the middle side of the knee,  and the two posteromedial portals (TPP), where two portals are made, technique.
The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these two techniques for the treatment for popliteal cysts.
We invited patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts who had previously undergone either surgery to participate in this study.
The patients had received arthroscopy treatment via the OPP technique or the TPP technique.
At the final follow-up, the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria, which evaluate knee joint symptoms,  and the Lysholm score for knee function were used for clinical evaluation.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed to detect the post-operative recurrence of cysts.
A total of 53 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were included in this study, including 25 in the OPP group and 28 in the TPP group.
The surgery time of the TPP group was significantly longer than that of the OPP group.
In the OPP group, the cysts disappeared in 17 patients and reduced in size in 8 patients.
In the TPP group, the cysts disappeared in 23 patients and reduced in size in 5 patients.
According to the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria, the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the TPP group (0%) than in the OPP group (4%).
There was no significant difference in the Lysholm score between the OPP group and the TPP group.
We conclude that the TPP technique is more effective and superior to the  OPP technique for the treatment of popliteal cysts.
