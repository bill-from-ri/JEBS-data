How to treat a bakers cyst?

The purpose of this study was to introduce a modified treatment technique using arthroscopy (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments for removal of popliteal or Baker's cyst). These cysts are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. We thought that this modified technique would be effective, so that cysts do not recur in patients who underwent the treatment.
 From January 2013 to January 2017, 34 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated with our technique.
Patients in a figure-of-four position (lying on back with opposite leg crossed over the knee) had two small holes, or portals, made in the middle rear side of their knees to allow enough space to open the  cyst valve, drain and remove the cyst.
We assessed reoccurence of the cysts using MRI and assigned scores to evaluate the clinical outcome
Patients underwent follow-up examination an average of  14.8 months following the procedure (range, 12 to 36 months).
We found and treated lesions (damaged tissue and cysts) within knee joint in all cases;
Damage to the cartilage of the knee was most common,  occuring in 23 (67.6%) of the cases
Patients' scores improved significantly after surgery, and MRI showed that the cysts did not reappear in any case.
We conclude that our arthroscopic techninque is effective and safe for treating popliteal cyst.
