What causes muscle spasm?

Dystonias are disorders with a lot of uncontrollable muscle contractions leading to awkward poses and/or repetitive movements.
Checking the symptoms can help identify patterns that focus identification testing on possible causes.
If a cause is found, specific cause-based treatments may be available.
In most cases, a specific cause cannot be found, and treatments are based on symptoms.
Treatment includes counseling, education, oral medications, botox (used as a muscle relaxant), and surgeries.
A noticeable decrease in symptoms and improved quality of life is achieved in most patients by combining these options.
