What causes muscle spasm?

Muscular cramp is a common symptom in healthy people, especially among the elderly and in young people after vigorous or peak exercise.
It is prominent in a number of benign neurological syndromes.
It is a particular feature of chronic neurogenic disorders, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
A literature review was undertaken to understand the diverse clinical associations of cramp and its neurophysiological basis, taking into account recent developments in membrane physiology and modulation of motor neuronal excitability.
Many aspects of cramping remain incompletely understood and require further study.
Current treatment options are correspondingly limited.
