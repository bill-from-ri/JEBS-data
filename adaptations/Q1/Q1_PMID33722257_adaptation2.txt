What causes muscle spasm?

Muscle cramps are unconscious contractions of muscles that are painful. When they happen during or after excercise, they are called Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC).
There are probably many causes of EAMC, but dehydration and lack of electrolytes (mineral salts dissolved in the blood) are thought to play roles.
This study tested whether drinking a special drink called Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) while exercising made Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps less likely than drinking spring water.
Ten men ran downhill in hot conditions for 40-60 minutes, drinking either spring water or ORS.
Their weights were measured 20 minutes into the exercise, then every 10 minutes, and then 30 minutes after the exercise was completed.
After each measurement, the men drank enough of either the spring water or ORS to make up for the weight they lost.
We did the experiment twice, a week apart, so that each person tried both drinks. We balanced which order they tried the drinks in.




Muscle cramps were easier to induce in participants who had drunk spring water than in participants who had drunk ORS.

Some electrolytes in the blood decreased for participants who were drinking only spring water.

The study showed that the drinking ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) during exercise made muscle cramps less likely.
