Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

Buspirone hydrochloride (HCl)1 is a new anxiety-reducing drug with a unique chemical structure.
The mechanism of action for this anxiety-reducing drug is unknown.
Unlike other anxiety-reducing drugs like benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, seizure-reducing, and muscle relaxant traits. Thus, the drug treats anxiety specifically.
As shown in a few studies, 15 to 30 mg/day of buspirone improves anxiety symptoms similarly to other common anxiety-reducing drugs.
Like anxiety-reducing diazepam, buspirone helps patients with mixed anxiety/depression. However, the number of patients studied is small.
In many studies, the anxiety-reducing effect manifests after 1 to 2 weeks, so motivating patients to comply may be needed.
Sedation is less frequent with buspirone than with other anxiety-reducing drugs. Other side effects are minor and infrequent.
In healthy volunteers, buspirone does not affect movement or thought. It also appears to not strengthen the effects of alcohol.
Buspirone may have limited potential for abuse and dependence.
Thus, while more use will better define its effects, buspirone rarely leads to sedation and is a useful a treatment option for anxiety.
Buspirone may become the preferred treatment for patients who demand daytime alertness.
