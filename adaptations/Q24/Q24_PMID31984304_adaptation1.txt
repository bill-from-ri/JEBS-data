Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

An 18-year-old woman went to one hospital with seizures after swallowing a large amount of lamotrigine (anti-seizure), bupropion (antidepressant), trazodone (antidepressant), buspirone (anti-anxiety), and possibly isoretinoin (acne).
She had a high heart rate (120 beats per minute).
A breathing tube was put in her windpipe to make sure she continued to breathe.
To treat a seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes or seizures occurring close together without recovery in between, she was given lorazepam (anti-seizure), propofol (anesthesia), and phenobarbital (anti-seizure).
She was transferred to another hospital.


The patient did not have an irregular heartbeat.



Her breathing tube was removed and she was sent to a psychiatric facility after 13 days in the hospital.
