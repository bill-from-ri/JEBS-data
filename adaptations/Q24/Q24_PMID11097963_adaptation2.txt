Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

107 patients with diagnosed anxiety and who used anxiety-reducing benzodiazepine drugs (for 8.5 years on average) entered a program that ended their drug use. The program measured how antidepressant imipramine (180 mg/day) and anxiety-reducing busprione (38 mg/day) helps end benzodiazepine use compared to inactive treatment.
After using either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam (anxiety-reducing benzodiazepines) for a period of time, patients used imipramine, busprione, or an inactive placebo for 4 weeks while benzodiazepine usage was stable.
For 4-6 weeks, patients lessened benzodiazepine use. Then, for 5 weeks, patients kept using imipramine, busiprone, and inactive treatment until 3 weeks in this 5-week phase, at which all patients switched to inactive treatment for 2 weeks.
Benzodiazepine blood levels were measured weekly.
Benzodiazepine-free status was checked 3 and 12 months after treatment.
Patients were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three failed attempts to lessen drug use.
Success rate for lessening drug use was higher for patients taking imipramine (82.6%) and not much higher for patients taking buspirone (67.9%) compared to patients taking the inactive placebo (37.5%).
The imipramine effect was still high even after accounting for benzodiazepine dose, baseline level of anxious symptoms, and duration of benzodiazepine treatment.
Ending benzodiazepine drug use can be helped by using imipramine before and during the period of benzodiazepine drug use reduction.
Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of starting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and length of benzodiazepine use help predict successful reduction of drug use.
