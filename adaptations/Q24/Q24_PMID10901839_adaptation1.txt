Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

We rated the effectiveness and effects of gradual or fast withdrawal of clobazam (a benzodiazepine which helps treat anxiety) in treating generalized anxiety disorder compared to lorazepam and buspirone, other anxiety-treating drugs.
128 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders participated in the study and received treatment for three weeks.
We divided patients into 4 groups: 32 patients taking clobazam, quickly withdrawn and replaced with sugar pills; group 2: 29 patients taking clobazam, gradually withdrawn over 3 weeks and replaced with sugar pills; group 3: 33 patients taking lorazepam, gradually withdrawn over 3 weeks and replaced with sugar pills; group 4: 34 patients taking buspirone, quickly withdrawn and replaced with sugar pills.
The amount taken was increased gradually during the first week of treatment.
At the end of this time, the patients took either 30 mg clobazam, 30 mg buspirone, or 3 mg lorazepam every day.
After the first week, a common questionnaire measuring severity of anxiety symptoms showed improvement in people taking clobazam and lorazepam but not in people taking buspirone.
All the drugs worked equally well after three weeks of treatment.
The anti-anxiety effects lasted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, with no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms.
We found no relevant difference in safety between the 4 groups.
Drowsiness in patients taking clobazam and lorazepam and nausea and headache in patients taking buspirone were the main side effects reported.
We conclude that clobazam, like lorazepam, improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of treatment, effectiveness of the 3 drugs was similar and lasted after patients stopped taking the drugs.
