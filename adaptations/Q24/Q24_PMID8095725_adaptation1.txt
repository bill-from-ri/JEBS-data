Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

We studied effects on breathing and behavior of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR; a molecule that receives signals for a cell) inverse agonist (a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist or stimulating molecule but causes an opposite response) ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) alone and with the anxiety-reducing drugs of buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in monkeys.
For the breathing-related studies, one group of monkeys breathed air or 5% CO2 mixed in air; breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed were measured.
For the behavior studies, another group of monkeys responded to food given every thirty seconds.
The increased breathing effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were increased by previously taking the drugs of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg).
Taking buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) at the same time also increased effects of beta-CCE under the food schedule.
The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed especially under the 5% CO2 condition. Lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on behavior responding on the food schedule.
These latter results shows that effects on breathing and behavior of beta-CCE in monkeys are at least due to effects at BZRs.
The results also suggest that benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites activated at the same time cause an effect greater than their individual effects or that beta-CCE and buspirone work similarly independent of the receptor where BZR inverse antagonists work.
