Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

We studied 44 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
Patients were taking a benzodiazepine before the study and were stabilized on 3 to 5 mg/day lorazepam for 5 weeks (weeks 0-5), both anxiety-reducing drugs.
We randomly assigned patients to take 15 mg/day buspirone - a possible anxiety-reducing drug - or sugar pills for the next 6 weeks (weeks 6-11).
During weeks 6 to 7, patients gradually stopped taking lorazepam.
During weeks 12 to 13, all patients took sugar pills.
At the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, we measured severity of anxiety symptoms using common questionnaires.
At the same times, we measured side effects using another questionnaire.
At the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13, we measured withdrawal symptoms using a common checklist.
The results favored buspirone over sugar pills and were similar to lorazepam.
Patients taking buspirone showed no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms compared to sugar pills.
Buspirone, similar to sugar pills, caused fewer side effects than lorazepam.
Finally the anti-anxiety effects of buspirone lasted at least 2 weeks after patients stopped taking the studied drugs.
