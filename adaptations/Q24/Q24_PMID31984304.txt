Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

An 18 year-old woman presented to an outside hospital with seizure activity after a massive ingestion of lamotrigine, bupropion, trazodone, buspirone, and possibly isoretinoin.
Her initial vital signs were remarkable for tachycardia (120 bpm).
She was intubated for airway protection.
For treatment of status epilepticus, she received a total of 12 mg of IV lorazepam along with a lorazepam infusion titrated to 15 mg/hr, a propofol infusion of unknown dosing, and phenobarbital 650 mg.
She was transferred to a receiving hospital.
Her initial ECG at the receiving hospital showed a QRS of 117 ms which narrowed with 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate after approximately 6 hours.
She required norepinephrine intermittently for blood pressure support for approximately 2 days.
The patient had no dysrhythmias.
EEG showed no epileptiform activity from approximately 11 hours-32 hours post ingestion.
At the receiving hospital, her serum lamotrigine concentration was 109 mcg/mL (reference 3.0-14.0 mcg/mL) 7 hours after ingestion.
Her bupropion concentration was 92 ng/mL (reference 50-100 ng/mL).
She was extubated on hospital day 5 and discharged to a psychiatric facility on hospital day 13.
