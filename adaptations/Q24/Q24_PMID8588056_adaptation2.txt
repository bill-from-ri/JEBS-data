Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

This study compares the effects and abrupt stoppage of anxiety-reducing buspirone drug use (15 or 20 mg three times a day) and anxiety-reducing lorazepam drug use (3 or 4 mg three times a day) after 8 weeks of treatment.
43 patients with diagnosed anxiety participated in the study. 39 entered the drug withdrawal phase.
Clinical measurements were taken at start, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks (active phase) and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase).

Lorazepam and buspirone had similar effectiveness when used. However, buspirone affected sleep, appetite, and concentration differently compared to lorazepam.
No withdrawal effects were seen with either drug.
Buspirone was as effective as lorazepam with patients with diagnosed anxiety.
Buspirone may have differed in effectiveness compared to lorazepam for treating certain physical symptoms common with anxiety disorder.
