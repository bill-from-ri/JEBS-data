How long to recover immune system from prednisone treatment?

In rheumatoid arthritis (when the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints, by mistake), nighttime release of proinflammatory cytokines (a type of molecule from immune cells that is capable of creating inflammation) is not prevented well by endogenous glucocorticoid (a type of steroid hormones produced within the body such as in tissues) and is connected with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain.
Taking exogenous or external glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the usual time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients.
Modified-release prednisone tablets are developed to allow it to be taken at bedtime for programmed or scheduled delivery of glucocorticoid during the night.
Several studies are conducted, each with 24 or less healthy people, to compare pharmacokinetics (how the body handles or responds to a drug) of a single oral dose of modified-release prednisone (a release of part of a drug at a time other than right after the drug is taken) and the regular prednisone.
There is no great difference in pharmacokinetic measures of the doses besides the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets.
Taking the drug after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but how much of the drug that was circulating or floating in the body is reduced under fasted conditions (on an empty stomach or before the first meal of the day).
Evaluating the effect of the drug in 9 patients with rheumatoid arthritis confirmed that modified-release (delayed release) prednisone tablets taken at bedtime with or after an evening meal results in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after taking the tablets.
