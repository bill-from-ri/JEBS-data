How long to recover immune system from prednisone treatment?

Kidney transplant receivers appeared puffy and obese while on low doses of steroid from a three-part therapy of immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine.
The treatment group had adult kidney transplant receivers with stable transplants who had received their kidney transplant at least 1 year ago (43 studies done in 22 men and 20 women) with average daily immunosuppressive prednisone dose.
The baseline group was healthy nontransplant patients.

The average immunosuppressive prednisolone dose measurement for all transplant receivers was higher than the baseline group by around 50%.
A certain test score was higher in female receivers and receivers taking the immunosuppressive cyclosporin drug.
The highest score was in women on estrogen supplements taking the cyclosporin drug.
More patients on the three-part therapy had steroid side effects versus those on steroid and the immunosuppressive azathioprine drug (17/27 versus 4/15). More women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22). The immunosuppressive prednisone drug score was higher in those with side effects than without.
CsA drug increases the usuable amount of immunosuppressive prednisolone drug.
The increased exposure to steroid increased steroid side effect severity in a majority of patients.
Since the major contributor to test scores was maximum post-dose concentration, single-point monitoring (monitoring 2 hours post-dose) may be used for routine studies.
