How long to recover immune system from prednisone treatment?

The effects of single oral (by mouth) doses of prednisone (a type of man-made steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on circulating mononuclear cells (major cells in the body that signal the immune system), autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (the availability of non T-cells to stimulate T-cells), mitogen responses (to help measure immune response), and allogeneic MLR (grouping of white blood cells called lymphocytes from unrelated individuals resulting in T cell activation) are studied in healthy volunteers.
Low doses were immunosuppressive (drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ), causing reduced circulation and amounts of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection) and monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), and major losses in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses.
The maximum effect occurred 6 hours after the drug is provided, and effects are gone by 24 hours.
Autologous MLR responses are very sensitive to the effects of prednisone and were significantly and consistently slowed or stopped 2 hours after the drug was provided.
Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills foreign organisms like bacteria and activates other immune system cells) were more easily slowed than responding T cells.
Because autologous MLR may be important in in vivo (experiments within a living human or animal) monitoring of immune responses, its reduction by low dose glucocorticoids (medicines that fight inflammation and work with your immune system) may be important.
This suppressive (slowing down) effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs.
