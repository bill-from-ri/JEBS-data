How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

Certain molecular tools called RT-PCR assays test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can cause a threatening breathing-related illness.
RT-PCR tests are very specific and detecting a target when there is none (or a false positive) is low. However, not detecting a target when there is one (or a false negative) is possible depending on the swab and time since symptoms.
The authors' aim is to determine the likelihood of a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptoms and swab type.

The chance of detecting the target decreased with time since symptoms. Also, oropharyngeal (OP) or mouth samples are less likely to detect the target than nasopharyngeal (NP) or nasal samples.
The chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was reduced if tests showing no detection were repeated 24 hours later.
For a small false-positive test chance (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests or tests detecting the target.
For a higher false-positive test likelihood, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests.
NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples.
The later an infected individual is tests after symptoms show, the less likely they are to test positive.
Time since symptoms has implifications for identifying infected patients, tracing spread, and releasing recovering patients who may still be infectious.
