How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

The number of blood tests that check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19, the lung infection) has skyrocketed in the past year.
Concerns have been raised on the performance of the tests, depending on the disease severity and the time of the test after symptoms start.
Therefore, confirming the performance of the test using an unbiased sample is required in order to understand and describe the antibody data.
Researchers aim to assess the performance of six available blood tests, the seroconversion (when the body starts producing antibodies), and how the body creates antibodies in response to coronavirus infection.
The study included 528 blood samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to 6 months after the start of symptoms and 161 blood samples from healthy people.
The total amount of antibodies increased and remained above 95% after six months when using certain tests to identify antibodies.
At early times after the start of symptoms, a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that suggest recent infection has the best ability to correctly diagnose a positive (or virus-containing) case.
Two types of antibodies, IgM and IgG, appear at the same time in most circumstances, and when performed together, the ability to correctly diagnose a positive diagnosis increases.
The severe and the moderate clinical forms have major associations with a higher number of positive tests and antibody levels.
The ability to correctly have a negative (or no virus) test among negative people is found in all evaluated blood tests, but the ability to correctly diagnose a true positive varies depending on the time after the start of symptoms and the type of test.
