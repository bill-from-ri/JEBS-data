How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

This study monitors virus amonts and naturally-created blood antibodies, which combat foreign viruses, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disorder, among infected patients and carries without symptoms from returning healthy travelers.
The throat swabs, mucus, and poop samples from 57 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, and 8 virus carries without symptoms, among 170 returning healthy travelers, were tested with a molecular tool.

Results show higher virus amount in throat, mucus, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms first showed among severely ill COVID-19 patients.
Shorter virus lifetime (1-8 days) was seen in the throat near the mount and digestive tract of carriers without symptoms.
Specific blood antibody detection rates were 18/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 carriers without symptoms, respectively, within 66 days from start of symptoms or detection.
Average duration between start of symptoms and antibody results was 30 and 23 days, respectively.
Of the 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were infected showing no symptoms (8/170) within 2 weeks. Antibdoy detection rate was 12.8% (12/94).
Antibody detection confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite other test results not detecting the virus.
Relative to other breathing-related viral infectious diseases, COVID-19 has fewer carriers without symptoms, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered and contacted healthy people.
These results show the complexity of COVID-19 spread.
