How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

For many infections from viruses, traces of the infection can remain in the body after symptoms and transmission (or spread) to others stop.
For Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), the relationship between a positive (or virus-detected) nasal swab where a sample is taken from the back of the nose and throat, the development of antibodies (proteins in the body) that fight Covid-19, and the clinical history is unclear.
In this study, people who recovered from Covid-19 and volunteered to donate plasma (the liquid part of blood) are screened for genetic material of the virus using a nasal swab. These volunteers also answer a series of questions and are tested for Covid-19 antibodies.
There are 11.8% who tested positive for coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, using a nasal swab 14 days after symptoms stopped.
Medical history does not show a big association with ongoing positive nasal swab tests.
Also, a positive nasal swab >14 days after symptoms stop is not correlated with antibodies against Covid-19 in the plasma.
A test measuring the increase of antibodies against Covid-19 relates with being in the hospital for Covid-19.
Antibodies against Covid-19 corresponded with time after symptoms stopped to when the samples are collected and how long symptoms lasted.
In conclusion, traces of genetic material from coronavirus can be found long after symptoms end in a significant percentage of people who have been diagnosed, which is important to remember when reading swab test results.
Continuing to test positive does not correspond with antibody strength or symptoms of Covid-19.
If measuring antibodies is used to understand plasma strength, individuals who have had serious Covid-19 disease symptoms may be better donors or donators.
