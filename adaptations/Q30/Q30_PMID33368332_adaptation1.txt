How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

Diagnosis of cases of coronavirus (a virus causing the lung infection known as Covid-19) is based on the count of positive RT-PCR tests, a type of test that looks for traces of DNA from the virus and signals positive if there is virus present.
The amount of virus in the body, called the viral load, measured by the RT-PCR test is seen as an indication of coronavirus infection.
However, the association of the amount of virus and the severity of the disease is not yet understood.
Samples from the back of the nose from 458 patients are tested by RT-PCR for coronavirus.
Additional tests are done to measure the viral load.

The most common signs are cough, muscle aches and pains, and fever.
High blood pressure, diseases affecting the brain and nerves, asthma, and hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormone in the body) were the most frequent conditions of other illnesses.
Fever, either as the only symptom or combined with others, is associated with high viral loads.
During the first week after symptoms start in mild patients up to 60 years-old is the peak of viral load.
Children under 10 years old have a high viral load in the first 2 days post-infection followed by a sharp decline.
Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days after infection.
Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the start of symptoms, indicating the virus stays present in them longer.
These findings suggest the viral load in swabs from the nose would help to monitor the coronavirus infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.
