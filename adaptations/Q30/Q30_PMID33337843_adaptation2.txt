How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is a viral breathing-related disease, has affected over 100 countries worldwide. The hospital release criteria of patients with COVID-19 varies across countries.
In China, patients with two tests detecting no virus and taken at least one day apart can be released with no further isolation needed.
Currently, testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome cornoavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, in poop samples in not regularly performed.
We show a patient with COVID-19, whose poop, but not nose swabs, shows traces of the virus.
Poop sample collected on 27th of February shows signs of the virus, 24 days after the first nose swab that did not detect the virus.
Based on the 2003 SARS virus epidemic, we recommend that poop testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be added to the hospital release criteria to minimize risk of spread from the digestive tract.
