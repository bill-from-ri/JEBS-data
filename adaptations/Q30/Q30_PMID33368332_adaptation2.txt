How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

Detecting cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disease, is based on the count of people which a certain molecular test (real-time RT-PCR) detects.
Viral amount by real-time RT-PCR may be a signal of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
However, the link between viral amount and severity of the disease is unknown.
Nasal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.


Most common symptoms were cough (75.8%), muscle pain (66.7%), and fever (48.5%).
High blood pressure (18.2%), brain-related diseases (15.1%), and asthma and reduced thyroid function, which affects metabolism, (12.1%) were the most frequent associated conditions.
Fever, either alone or with other symptoms, was linked with a high virus amount.
The peak of the virus amount was detected in the first week after symptoms started in mild patients up to 60 years-old.
Children under 10 years have a high virus amount in the first 2 days after infection with a sharp decline after.
Cases between 10 and 49 years mostly showed low to medium virus amount during the first 2 days after infection.
Patients over 60 years have a high virus amount up to the second week after symptoms start, indicating the longer presence of the virus in them.
The virus amount in nasal swabs may help monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection in cases of mild coronavirus disease 2019, a breathing-related viral disease.
