How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

Collection of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the viral, respiratory illness Covid-19, also called convalescent plasma, began in two hospitals in Brazil for treatment of severe patients.
People recovering from mild or moderate Covid-19 infection are selected as donors for blood plasma if they have had no symptoms for at least 14 days. Additional tests are done for other infections such as hepatitis and HIV and for antibodies (or infection-fighting proteins) for Covid-19.
Among 271 blood plasma donors, 250 have antibodies in the body to fight Covid-19.
In 77% of donors, no genetic trace of Covid-19 is found from a swab test and in 88.4%, none is found in blood.
At more than 28 days after full recovery, 59 out of 174 are negative (with no virus detected), and 25 out of 69 are positive (with virus detected), but 13 of these are between 35 and 48 days.
Additional tests are done to learn more about the level of antibodies in the blood.


Blood plasma collection showed a decline in antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from entering cells.
The donor's weight, days between the start of the disease and repeated plasma collection, and antibody levels are important for predicting possible antibody concentration that can keep the virus from entering cells.
In conclusion, a positive test that finds genetic traces of the virus are still detected in 36.2% of cases within 28 to 48 days after recovery.
High levels of certain antibody proteins may be used to identify antibodies that can neutralize the virus and make it inactive.
