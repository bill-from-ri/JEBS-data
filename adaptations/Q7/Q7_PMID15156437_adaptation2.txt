How is strep throat treated?

We reviewed 9 randomized trials (with 2113 patients) comparing cephalosporins (antibacterial antibiotics) with penicillin (another antibiotic) for treating group A beta -hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis (a bacterial throat infection) in adults.
Results favored cephalosporins over penicillin.
Results favored cephalosporins.
Results favored cephalosporins over penicillin.
The risk of treatment failure for bacterial strep throat is 2 times higher for oral penicillin antibiotics than for cephalosporins antibiotics.
