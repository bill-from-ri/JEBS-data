How is strep throat treated?

In patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis a specific diagnosis should be determined by performing a throat culture or a rapid antigen-detection test with a throat culture if the rapid antigen-detection test is negative, at least in children.
Penicillin is the preferred treatment, and a first-generation cephalosporin is an acceptable alternative unless there is a history of immediate hypersensitivity to a beta-lactam antibiotic.
