How is strep throat treated?

A European society created a group to update guidelines to identify and treat patients with sore throat.
Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen, or foreign protein, testing can help target antibiotics (antibacterial medication).
The Centor scoring system can help identify those with higher risk of group A streptococcal or strep bacterial infection.
In patientis with high risk of streptoccal bacterial infections, physicians may use rapid antigen, or foreign protein, testing (RAT).
If rapid antigen testing is used, testing isolated throat cells are not needed for identifying group A strep bacterial infection if no antigens are detected.
Either ibuprofen or paracetamol, common pain relievers, can help relieve immediate sore throat symptoms.
Zinc gluconate, a dietary supplement, is not recommeded with a sore throat.
There is inconsistent evidence that herbal treatments or acupuncture treats sore throat.
Patients with less severe sore throats should not use antibiotics to relieve symptoms.
Limited benefits of antibiotics, seen in patients with severe sore throat, have to be weighed against antibiotic side effects, its effects on bacteria, medicalisation and costs.
Preventing pus is not a sign for antibacterial medication in sore throat.
If using antibiotics, penicillin V, two or three times daily for 10 days is recommended.
Currently, there is not enough evidence for shorter treatment length.
