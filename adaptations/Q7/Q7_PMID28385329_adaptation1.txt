How is strep throat treated?

Our objective is to compare two antibiotics, azithromycin (AZT) and benzathine penicillin (BP), in treating reoccurring inflamed tonsils in children.
284 of 350 children with reoccurring inflamed tonsils caused by strep bacteria participated in the study. 162 children had surgery to treat reoccurring inflamed tonsils.
We divided the rest of the children, 122, into two groups.
Group A children got a single BP injection (600,000 international units for children weighing 27 kg or less and 1,200,000 international units for children over 27 kg) once a week for six months.
Group B children got a single dose of AZT by mouth (250 mg for children weighing 25 kg or less and 500 mg for children over 25 kg). Once a week for six months.
Both groups had results similar to getting surgery to remove the tonsils.
Drug safety and the reoccurring of inflamed tonsils were similar in both groups.
Group B followed doctor instructions better.
We concluded that AZT can treat reoccurring inflamed tonsils similar to BP with results similar to getting surgery to remove the tonsils.
