How is strep throat treated?

Doctors should give patients who are believed to have strep throat a throat culture (a test using a throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick) or a rapid strep test (a test using a throat swab to find fragments of bacteria in the throat that make you sick) followed by a throat culture if the rapid strep test finds no strep-related bacteria, at least in children.
Penicillin is prescribed most commonly. A first-generation cephalosporin, another kind of antibiotic, is another option if no allergies exist.
