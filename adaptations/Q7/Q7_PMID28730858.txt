How is strep throat treated?

Chronic GAS carrier state is best defined as the prolonged presence of group A Î²-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) in the pharynx without evidence of infection or inflammation.
Chronic GAS carriers have a low risk of immune mediated complications.
Persistent pharyngeal carriage often raises management issues.
In this study, we review the evidence on the management of persistent GAS carriage in children and propose a management algorithm.
Areas covered: Chronic GAS pharyngeal carriage is quite common affecting 10-20% of school-aged children.
Pathogenesis of carriage has been related to the pharynx microflora and to special properties of GAS, but several aspects are yet to be elucidated.
Management greatly depends on whether the individual child belongs to a 'high-risk' group and might benefit from eradication regimens or not, when observation-only and reassurance are enough.
Penicillin plus rifampin and clindamycin monotherapy have been recommended for eradication; limited evidence of effectiveness of azithromycin has been reported.
Surgical intervention is not indicated.
Expert commentary: GAS infection is a common reason for antibiotic use and abuse in children and asymptomatic carriers constitute the major reservoir of GAS in the community.
Several aspects are yet to be elucidated and well-designed studies are needed for firm conclusions to be drawn.
