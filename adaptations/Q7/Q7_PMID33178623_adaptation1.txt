How is strep throat treated?

Strep throat caused by bacteria is most commonly caused by group A strep bacteria.
5-15% of adults and 15-35% children in the United States with strep throat have a group A strep bacteria infection.
The symptoms of group A strep bacteria are similar to short-term strep throat caused by viruses and other bacteria, which makes strep throat hard to diagnose.
Diagnosing strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria begins with a careful physical exam and patient history.
Following a physical exam and patient history, there are five ways to diagnose strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria: scoring systems, rapid antigen tests to find strep bacterial fragments, throat swabs to grow strep bacteria, tests for strep genetic material, and computer predictions.
Clinical guidelines written by professional groups can help doctors choose which way to diagnose strep throat.
However, guidelines for diagnosing group A strep throat created by professional groups in the United States and Europe differ, and many doctors do not follow any guidelines.
Treating group A strep throat with painkillers, fever-reducers, and antibiotics aims to relieve symptoms, shorten illness length, prevent later medical problems with pus or without pus, and decrease the spread, while reducing the use of antibiotics when they are not needed.
Experts agree that antibiotics that kill fewer bacteria are best to treat strep throat.
Experts do not agree whether and when people with group A strep throat should be given antibiotics.
There is no best way to treat strep throat, as experts do not agree on the best way to diagnose group A strep throat and when antibiotics should be given.
