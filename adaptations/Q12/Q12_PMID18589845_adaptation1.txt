How can asthma be prevented?

Asthma, which usually begins in childhood and is the most common chronic disease of childhood, has become very widespread.
Asthma is connected with gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, and temperature) may shape asthma's development.
This review considers biologic factors, such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels, as well as sociologic factors, such as education and economic activity, in the development of allergies and asthma.
Studies show that the strategy of decreasing exposure to one allergen (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) does not impact asthma prevention.
However, decreasing exposure to more than one allergen has shown a positive effect, such as improved health or symptoms.
It is suggested that asthma and other allergic diseases represent an error in how our genes and the environment interact. The increasing number of cases may be a sign that the general population is at risk for developing other inflammatory (when the body reacts to an injury or infection) and autoimmune diseases (where the body attacks healthy cells).
A better understanding of the multiple factors that impact asthma and allergies may help researchers understand other chronic diseases.
