How can asthma be prevented?

It has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy study was published. The study explores the allergist's dream: determining whether allergen-specifc immunotherapy, treatment of disease by modifying immune system activity, can alter the disease and prevent asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (long-lasting nose and eye problems).
Two hundred and five children aged 6 to 14 with grass and/or birch pollen allergy were randomly selected either to receive 3 years of allergen-specific, below-skin injection immunotherapy (treatment of disease by modifying immune system activity) or to join a control group.
Some had moderate-to-severe hay fever symptoms, but none mentioned asthma at the start.
Treated children had fewer symptoms of asthma after 3 years.
Lung sensitivity tests were better in the treatment group.
Therefore, a 3-year course of injection of allergen-specifc immunotherapy in children with seasonal allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both reduces the risk of asthma.
