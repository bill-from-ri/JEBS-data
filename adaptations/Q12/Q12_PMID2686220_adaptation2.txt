How can asthma be prevented?

Bronchial hypperresponsiveness (increased lung sensitivity to airway-narrowing particles) or BHR as the main reason for developing asthma (a disease restricting breathing) may be modified by internal or external causes and environmental factors.
Proinflammatory particles with changes to throat mucus promote BHR.
Upper airway viral infections, allergen exposure, lasting enlargement of upper airways, airway irritants and pain-relievers may be the most common triggers of asthma in susceptible people.
BHR may be improved by treatment with antiinflammatory drugs and coastal weather.
Improvement with coastal weather may be because of reduced inhalative irritants and more complex reasons.
Possible ideas regarding the means of coastal weather cures are explored.
First, initial results from a mediterranean region show a negative effect of weather events like cold weather or faster wind speeds on the progression of asthma.
BHR improvement measured by lung response tests has been observed after weather therapy in the Baltic sea area.
Future studies about preventing asthma in people prone to BHR and allergy development should help with evaluating treatment effects and the importance of coastal weather therapy for those with bronchial asthma.
