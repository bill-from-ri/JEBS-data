How can asthma be prevented?

An early study on prevention of allergies aimed to determine if allergen-specific immunotherapy (allergy shots) can improve or prevent the development of asthma in children.
In this study, 205 children aged 6 to 14 years with allergies to grass and/or birch pollen were randomly put in either the group that received an allergy shot of immunotherapy for 3 years or in a no-treatment group.
None of the study participants reported having asthma at the time of the start of the study.
Children treated with the allergy shot had much fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years.
A test that measures how well the lungs are working were better in the group that received the allergy shot.
Receiving an allergy shot over the course of 3 years in children with allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both greatly reduced the risk of asthma.
