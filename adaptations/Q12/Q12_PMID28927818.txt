How can asthma be prevented?

It has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy (PAT) study was published, exploring the dream of the allergist: determining whether allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) can alter the natural course of disease and prevent the development of asthma in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis.
Two hundred five children aged 6 to 14 years with grass and/or birch pollen allergy were randomized to receive either allergen-specific injection immunotherapy with aluminum-adsorbed native allergen extract subcutaneous immunotherapy for 3 years or to an open control group.
Subjects had moderate-to-severe hay fever symptoms, but none of them reported asthma at the time of inclusion.
Actively treated children had significantly fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years, as evaluated by clinical diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.52; P < .05).
Methacholine bronchial provocation test results were significantly better in the active group.
Thus a 3-year course of injection AIT in children with hay fever to grass, birch pollen, or both significantly reduced the risk of asthma.
