How can asthma be prevented?

Several risk factors for developing asthma are linked with being exposed to certain things during pregnancy. Because conducting research on pregnant women is limited and findings are difficult to interpret, understanding these exposures is challenging.
A report published in a scientific journal called Pediatrics outlined the effects of the mother's and infant's nutrition on developing atopic diseases (a genetic tendency to develop an allergy), including asthma in children.
Exposure by the mother to vitamin D as a risk for childhood asthma has been investigated, but the results clash. Some studies report that vitamin D may protect against asthma attacks or prevent asthma symptoms from getting worse.
While many studies have investigated such links with the risk of developing a disease, the media often reports these findings without including details or other considerations.
