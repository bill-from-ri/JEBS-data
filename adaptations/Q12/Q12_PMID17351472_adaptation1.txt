How can asthma be prevented?

Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. The number of asthma cases is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries (countries with a high quality of life, developed economies, and advanced technologies).
The present review focuses on recent literature on asthma prevention in childhood.
Recent findings show that exposure to some things in the environment as an infant or in early childhood is associated with reduced number of asthma cases, but how these associations are connected is unknown.
Recent studies also show limited success in preventing asthma or asthma symptoms when asthma medications are used and then those medicines are stopped.
Immunotherapy (treatment that activates or alters the immune system to treat a disease) is another way to prevent asthma.
Several studies that use multiple treatment (drugs, therapy, or other steps to improve health) methods showed reduced symptoms of asthma, but these studies did not see any major differences in other measures, such as how well the lungs carried air.
In summary, the most promising way to prevent asthma is to use more than one treatment that include changing environmental exposures and diet.
More research is needed to understand how the effect of multiple treatments last and to evaluate new treatments to prevent asthma in childhood.
