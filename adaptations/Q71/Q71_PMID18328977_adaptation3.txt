What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Achondroplasia is a type of dwarfism and the most common nonlethal bone growth impairment.
Achondroplasia affects between one in 10,000 and 30,000 people.
Achondroplasia is characterized by short stature, shortened limbs, enlarged head, disproportionate face, curvature in the lower back and is associated with normal cognitive development.
A mutation in a gene called type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3) causes achondroplasia.
Achondroplasia is diagnosed by physical examination and confirmed by X-ray.
A person with achondroplasia is cared for by a multidisciplinary team that will prevent and treat complications, including spinal cord squeezing, hearing loss and development of a hump in the back.
Weight counselling, psychosocial guidance and professional integration programmes play an important role in the global quality of life of these patients and their families.
