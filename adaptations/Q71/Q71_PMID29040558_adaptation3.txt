What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gain-of-function mutations cause dwarfisms, including achondroplasia (ACH) and thanatophoric dysplasia (TD).
The continuously active state of FGFR3 disrupts normal process of bone growth.
Bone-growth abnormalities have been identified in which primary cilia (PC) function is disrupted. Primary cilia are long protrusions on cells that act as an antenna and are important during development.
In human ACH and TD, the impact of FGFR3 mutations on PC in growth plate cartilage remains unknown.
Here, the authors showed that in cartilage cells from ACH and TD patients and mice with Fgfr3 mutation, the FGFR3 is overactive and it perturbed PC length and formation.
They demonstrated that inhibiting FGFR3, using a drug inhibitor, rescued both PC length and formation.
The authors also studied the impact of a drug inhibitor of a signaling pathway.
Interestingly, the drug also rescued PC length and formation.
Together, we provide evidence that the growth plate defects ascribed to FGFR3-related dwarfisms are potentially due to loss of PC function, and these dwarfisms may represent a novel type of bone growth disorders with defective cilia formation.
