What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Achondroplasia is a human bone growth impairment and is the most common form of inherited disproportionate short stature.
Achondroplasia tends to run in families, an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing it to their child.
Most people with achondroplasia have a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.
Characteristics of achodroplasia can be easily identified from physical exams and X-rays; they include disproportionate short stature with limb shortening, large head with prominence of forehead, underdevelopment of the middle part of the face and a short stubby hands with a separation betweem the middle and ring fingers.
The majority of people with achondroplasia have normal intelligence, but many social and medical complications may compromise a full and productive life.
Some of them have serious health consequences related to hydrocephalus, craniocervical junction compression, or upper-airway obstruction.
In this article, we discuss a number of treatments from surgical limb lengthening and Growth Hormone treatment, to future treatments, including therapy using a bone formation stimulator called C-type natriuretic peptide.
The discussion is a comparative study of the complications and drawbacks of various experiments using numerous strategies.
