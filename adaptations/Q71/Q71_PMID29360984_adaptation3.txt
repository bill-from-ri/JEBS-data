What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Cilia are projections present in almost every cell. Cilia integrate signals from outside the cells and those within the cells. 
Continuous activation of FGFR3 signaling produces the bone growth disorders achondroplasia (ACH) and thanatophoric dysplasia (TD), but many of the molecular mechanisms underlying these remain unresolved.
Here, the authors report that primary cilia in ACH and TD cartilage growth regions are significantly shorter.
Data demonstrate that transient versus continuous activation of fibrblast growth factor (FGF) signaling correlates with size of the cilia.
Transient FGF pathway activation elongated cilia, while continuous activity shortened cilia.
FGF signaling extended primary cilia via  a pathway involving ERK MAP kinase and mTORC2, but not through mTORC1.

Authors uncover a FGF-cilia pathway that is involved in the mechanisms of FGFR function, and should be considered in the development of therapies for FGFR function.
