Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Even though there are newer drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery, current guidelines recommend the drug perphenazine. A multi-process way to prevent nausea and vomiting in high-risk patients requires using more than two drugs.
We aimed to rate the success and safety of perphenazine in prevention of nausea and vomiting in adults and children.
We looked at eleven studies published between 1965 and 1999 with a total of 2081 people.
Perphenazine 0.07 mg kg and 5 mg prevented nausea and vomiting in children and adults, respectively.
We saw no big differences compared to newer drugs like ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol in studies with limited results.
Side effects were not well reported.
Short-term sedation occurred in three studies.
Studies show that perphenazine prevents nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious side effects compared to sham treatment.
