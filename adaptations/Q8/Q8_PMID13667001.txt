Who is prescribed perphenazine?

CLINICAL experience with tranquilizers has shown the need for prolonged therapy for chronic neurotic and psychotic disorders.
Since phenothiazine derivatives such as perphenazine are being employed in this manner and since there have been rare reports of jaundice and leukopenia associated with its administration, questions about a potential deleterious effect of this drug on the liver and blood have to be answered.
