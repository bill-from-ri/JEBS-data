Who is prescribed perphenazine?

To improve how well treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, works, we looked at studies on the disease-related processes associated with glioblastoma and their interaction with how the antipsychotic perphenazine affects the body.
That study found five areas of possibly helpful interaction.
Studies showed 5 independent qualities of perphenazine that might help treat glioblastoma, including changing how cells grow and move and reducing nausea.
Perphenazine can be taken with current chemotherapy and radiation treatments and with commonly prescribed glioblastoma drugs.
These qualities suggest the addition of perphenazine to current chemotherapy and radiation treatment should be studied.
Part of the brain sends out damaged cells that become recurring glioblastoma after they move outward.
This paper shows how perphenazine might decrease this activity.
Perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap drug used to treat psychotic disorders worldwide since the 1950s.
Studies over time have shown perphenazine does not cause many side effects in normal people, people with mental illness, and ill people taking perphenazine to reduce nausea.
As of Summer 2020, glioblastoma requires multiple drugs to treat it until and unless it is better understood and a single treatment drug is found.
We conclude that perphenazine has many qualities that suggest its use in treating glioblastoma.
