Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) can be taken by mouth for the following uses: (1) as a nonsedating drug to prevent nausea and vomiting; (2) like promethazine, an antihistamine (allergy drug) , to prevent psychotic symptoms caused by ketamine (a pain relief drug); and (3) as a safe one-dose drug.
We also rated the success of one-dose OP8 compared to one 40 mg dose of aprepitant, used to prevent nausea and vomiting, given to people before rectum, anus, and colon operations in our center with guidelines designed to help people recover more quickly from surgery, reduce opioid use, and reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery.
In this study, we saw no differences in nausea and vomiting prevention on the same day of surgery and one day after surgery between patients who got OP8 versus aprepitant.
As guidelines to help people recover more quickly from surgery become more widespread and used for other surgeries, successfully preventing nausea and vomiting after surgery is key to improving patient results.
OP8 should be studied as part of a cost-effective, multi-process way to help people recover more quickly from surgery.
