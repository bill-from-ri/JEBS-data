Who is prescribed perphenazine?

To try improving treatment in glioblastoma (a brain cancer), this work collected data on the cancer's symptoms and traits along with references to perphenazine (an anti-psychotic medication).
This study found five areas of possibly beneficial treatment.
5 perphenazine attributes of benefit to glioblastoma treatment include blocking two target sites for chemical messengers, reducing movement of specific cells, activating certain enzymes, and reducing nausea.
Perphenazine works with current chemradiotherapy and common medicines used to treat glioblastoma.
Perphenzaine attributes argue for a trial to add it to current standard treatment with temozolomide (an anti-cancer drug) and irradiation.
A specific brain region seeds the brain with mutated cells that become reappearing gliobastoma after outward movement.
The current work shows how perphenazine may reduce this outward growing brain cancer.
Perphenazine is an old, common, cheap antipsychotic drug used clinically worldwide since the 1950's.
Perphenzaine has been well-tolerated in psychiatric groups, in healthy groups, and in non-psychiatric but medically ill groups who use perphenazine to reduce nausea.
For now (Summer, 2020), glioblastoma needs a multi-drug approach until a core treatment can be identified.
Perphenazine has many attributes that recommend its use in glioblastoma treatment.
