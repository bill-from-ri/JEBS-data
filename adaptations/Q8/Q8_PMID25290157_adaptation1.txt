Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are the main treatment for schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness).
Treatment recommendations say there is no difference in treatment effect among older drugs used to treat psychotic disorders. However, doctors sometimes think older drugs with lower strength used to treat psychotic disorders do not work as well as older drugs with higher strength, and they also seem to have different side effects.
We conclude that the results do not show that the antipsychotic perphenazine with its higher strength works better than older antipsychotics with lower strength.
Some evidence exists that perphenazine is more likely to cause restlessness and less likely to cause drug toxicity in the bloodstream requiring hospitalization, but most side effects were the same.
More evidence is needed to make judgements, as the number and quality of studies is low with medium- to very low-quality results.
