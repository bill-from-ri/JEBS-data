How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic condition caused by a variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein.
A class II CFTR variant F508del (found in up to 90% of people with CF (pwCF)) is the commonest CF-causing variant.
The faulty protein is degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect transepithelial salt transport.
The F508del variant lacks meaningful CFTR function and corrective therapy could benefit many pwCF.
Therapies in this review include single correctors and any combination of correctors and potentiators.
