How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease inherited from both parents caused by genetic changes in the CF transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, which produces a compound (chloride) channel at the surface of epithelial cells (cells that cover outer surface of the internal organs).
Not enough Unsaturated Fatty Acid (UFA) has continually been seen in CF patients.
Scientists do not agree on the role of not enough UFA in causing CF.
We aim to discuss current beliefs on improper functioning of UFAs that comes from studies that sometime disagree.
Next, we suggest a way in which possible improper functioning of UFAs impacts CF cells, based on changes in the biological and physical characteristics of the cell membrane (known as lipointoxication).
Finally, we discuss how lipointoxication might play a role in the progression of CF disease and how it could affect how well current treatments work.
