How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride (Cl-) channel descended from an active transporter (requiring energy for movement).
One or more "lateral portals" may have appeared, switching the active pump to a channel.
"Lateral portals" allow Cl- ions (charged atoms) to move under the influence of an electric field.
These portals are the least understood part of Cl- movement. Scientists do not know the number of working portals, and if more than one, which portal does what.
We used a cell test to find out how positively charged side chemical groups in CFTR contribute to how the portal works.
Neutralization of many charged side chemical groups caused by gene sequence changes reduced movement of Cl- through a single channel.
However, these gene sequence changes affected channel blockade by negatively charged atoms differently.
We used many models to look at ways these positively charged chemical groups changed one or more portals and its effect on Cl- movement and interaction with blockers.
Our results suggest one portal is lined by many positively charged side chemical groups that interact with both CL- and other blocking negatively charged ions.
We further suggest that gene sequence changes at other sides change how well the single portal works.
We compared our results with recent information on CFTR structure to understand the pathway of Cl- transport at a molecule level.
