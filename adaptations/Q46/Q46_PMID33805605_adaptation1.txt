How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Cystic fibrosis is a deadly disease inherited from both parents characterized by changes in a compound (chloride) movement caused by genetic changes in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene.
One gene change, ΔF508-CFTR, causes the resulting protein the gene creates to fold incorrectly, which leads to its destruction and mineral imbalance.
CF patients are at very high risk of developing long-term inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) of part of the lungs.
When tissue cells are damaged, immune cells are stimulated and produce unstable molecules, prompting the immune system to defend the body.
In addition to normal treatments, drugs called correctors are available for changes like ΔF508-CFTR and other less common changes.
Correctors help the CFTR protein form the right shape to move to the surface of the epithelial cell (cell that covers outer surface of the internal organs).
Matrine, a drug, starts ΔF508-CFTR release from the cell's transportation system through the cell liquid to the surface.
We now have proof that Matrine and Lumacaftor, another drug, not only allow the changed CFTR to move, but probably neutralize inflammation by improving the course of the disease.
