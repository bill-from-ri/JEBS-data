How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic, autosomal, recessive disease characterized by an alteration of chloride transport caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene.
The loss of Phe residue in position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR) causes an incorrect folding of the protein causing its degradation and electrolyte imbalance.
CF patients are extremely predisposed to the development of a chronic inflammatory process of the bronchopulmonary system.
When the cells of a tissue are damaged, the immune cells are activated and trigger the production of free radicals, provoking an inflammatory process.
In addition to routine therapies, today drugs called correctors are available for mutations such as ΔF508-CFTR as well as for others less frequent ones.
These active molecules are supposed to facilitate the maturation of the mutant CFTR protein, allowing it to reach the apical membrane of the epithelial cell.
Matrine induces ΔF508-CFTR release from the endoplasmic reticulum to cell cytosol and its localization on the cell membrane.
We now have evidence that Matrine and Lumacaftor not only restore the transport of mutant CFTR protein, but probably also counteract the inflammatory process by improving the course of the disease.
