How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

The tongue is the most common cause of blocked upper airways, seen most often in people in comas or cardiac arrest (abrupt heart stop).
Other common causes of blocked upper airways include swelling of the middle part of the throat and voice box, injury, objects that shouldnâ€™t be swallowed, and infection.
Treatment of the patient with blocked upper airways depends on the cause of the blockage, the training and skills of the rescuer, and the availability of additional treatments needed for advanced airway methods.
In most cases, simply positioning the patient or doing one of the three maneuvers to raise the tongue will open the airway of the patient in a coma or cardiac arrest.
In people thought to have swallowed an object that should not be swallowed, stomach or chest compression should be done immediately, with removing the object with the fingers used only when these maneuvers do not work.
Most people with blocked airways that occur due to swelling, injury, or infection can be treated first without breathing tubes through the mouth or nose.
Breathing tubes should be used before surgery in most instances of blocked upper airways.
Sometimes, however, surgery to cut a hole in the neck is needed to open the airway.
The experience and skills of the rescuing doctor or paramedic mostly determines the approach.
Usually, a surgery to cut a hole in the neck is simpler and easier to do than opening the windpipe, especially for a doctor who does not have surgery training or the rescuer who is not a doctor.
Regardless of the method used to open the airway in a patient with blocked upper airways, it must be done quickly, and air must be supplied to the person once the airway is open.
