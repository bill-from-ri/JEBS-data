How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Stomach thrusts or the Heimlich maneuver is the first-aid procedure used to treat partial or complete blockage of the upper airway from an object that shouldn't be swallowed.
This skill is commonly taught during basic life support and advanced heart life support classes, but it never gets as much attention as chest compressions and rescue breaths do.
The stomach thrust maneuver can be done in both children and adults using different ways.
In the 1960s, choking on food, toys, and other objects was the sixth leading cause of accidental death in the United States.
Slapping a person on the back was the most common response and was often found to not work, sometimes even pushing the object further down.
Dr. Henry Heimlich introduced the Heimlich maneuver in 1974 after proving his idea that stored air in the lung could push objects out of the throat by fast upward thrusts under the ribcage.
The medical community then did not accept the maneuver right away.
The American Red Cross (ARC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) pushed backslaps for 10 years after the Heimlich maneuver was introduced.
Today, the Heimlich maneuver is accepted and taught during basic life support and advanced heart life support classes for conscious adults, but backslaps are still recommended for infants. Chest compressions are recommended for unconscious people.
Furthermore, people have come up with different ways of doing the maneuver with mixed results.
