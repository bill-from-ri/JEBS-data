How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

The best treatment for an unconscious person choking, whether in the hospital or by first responders, should include removal of the object that should not be swallowed with a medical tool while clearly seeing the object.
However, experts do not agree about the best way to treat a conscious person with partial or complete blockage of the airway and the unconscious person for whom medical tools are not available.
Which way to force air out of a person's lungs works the best to clear the blocked airway?
Which way should be used first?
What are the complications of the different ways?
Is any way dangerous or harmful?
To date, there is no agreement on any of these issues.
Studies disagree as to which way creates the highest pressure in the chest that forces air out of the lungs and highest airflow rates.
Most studies support the idea that blows to the back make the highest pressure in the chest that forces air out of the lungs, while stomach thrusts make the highest airflow rate.
All the ways work somewhat to clear the blocked airway on their own; however, each way seems to work much better when combined with another way.
Also, pressure applied as a series of jolts seems to work better than steadily applied pressure.
