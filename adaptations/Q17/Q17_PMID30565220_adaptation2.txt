How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Oral poisoning is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with over 100,000 deaths from unintended poisoning yearly and noticeably by chlidren younger than five years.
Any useful treatment that anyone can use to prevent intake or control the poison before help arrives may limit the poisoning and save lives.
The objective is to measure the effects of pre-hospital treatments (alone or in combination) for immediate oral poisoning, available to anyone before professional help arrives.
The studies in this review provided mostly unreliable evidence about using first aid treatments for immediate oral poisoning.
An key limitation is that only one study actually occured in a pre-hospital setting, which weakens our faith in the usefulness of these results to this setting.
Thus, the evidence is not enough to make any conclusions.
