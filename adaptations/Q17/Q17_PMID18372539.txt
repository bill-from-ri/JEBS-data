How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

The airway obstruction concerns any situation that clogs partially or totally the normal pulmonary ventilation.
In this way, it is an absolute emergency which in case of not being solved leads to death in afew minutes.
One of the most common airway obstructions is the one that results from an extrinsic cause to the airway--food, blood or vomit.
Any solid object can work as a foreign body and cause an airway obstruction--mechanical obstruction.
Evaluation and control of the airway are carried out through quick and simple procedures.
Initially there is no need for any equipment, being just enough the application of manual techniques for control and disobliteration.
Interscapular claps, the Heimlich Manoeuvre and the Thoracic Compressions, are manual techniques used in the disobliteration of the respiratory tract due to a solid body.
