How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Definitive management of the unconscious choking victim, whether in hospital or in the field, should include removal of the foreign body by instrumentation under direct visualization.
However, there is debate as to the best management of the conscious victim with an obstructed upper airway and of the unconscious victim for whom such definitive instrumentation is not available.
Which artificial-cough maneuver is the most eficacious in clearing the obstructed airway?
Which maneuver should be used first?
What are the complications of the various techniques?
Is any maneuver dangerous or deleterious?
To date there is no consensus on any of these issues.
There are significant discrepancies in the literature as to which technique produces the highest intrathoracic pressures and airflow rates.
Most of the data seem to support the conclusion that blows to the back generate the highest intrathoracic pressure, whereas chest or abdominal thrust produces the highest airflow rate.
Clinically, all the maneuvers are somewhat efficacious in clearing the obstructed airway when used alone; however, each maneuver seems to be substantially more efficacious when used in combination with another maneuver.
Also, the results appear to be more successful when pressure is applied as a series of jolts rather than applied steadily.
