How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

The tongue is the most common cause of airway blockage, especially in comatose patients or those suffering cardiac arrest.
Other common causes of airway blockage include swelling from trapped fluid of the airway, trauma, something stuck in the airway, and infection.
Treating patients with airway blockage depends on its cause, the training and skills of the rescuer, and available airway devices needed for complex procedures.
Mostly, just arranging the patient or using one of three methods to elevate the tongue will open the airway of the comatose patient or person with cardiac arrest.
In patients with something stuck in the airway, abdominal or chest squeezing should be done quickly, with removal by fingers when squeezing is unsuccessful.
Most with blockage due to swelling from trapped fluid, trauma, or infection can be treated initially with breathing tubes.
Breathing tubes should be used before surgery of the airway in most cases of airway blockage.
Sometimes, however, airway surgery is needed to create an airway.
The chosen procedure depends largely on the experience and skills of the rescuer.
Mostly, surgery to add a tube to a specific airway location is simpler and easier than surgery to cut a hole in the windpipe, especially for rescuers and those not specialized or trained in surgery.
Despite the method used to create an airway for those with airway blockage, it must be done quickly and fresh air provided for the patient afterward.
