How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

The airway blockage has to do with any situation that partially or totally clogs normal breathing.
In this way, it is an emergency that if not solved leads to death in a few minutes.
One of the most common airway blockages is the one due to an outside cause--food, blood or vomit.
Any solid object can be an object that shouldn't be swallowed and block an airway--mechanical obstruction.
Assessing and managing the airway are done through quick and simple procedures.
At the beginning, there is no need for any equipment, with techniques by hand being enough for managing the airway and removing the blockage.
Backslaps, the Heimlich Maneuver and the Thoracic Compressions are techniques done using the hands to remove a solid blockage from the airways.
