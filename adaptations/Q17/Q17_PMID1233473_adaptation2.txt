How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

180 cases of head trauma were classified by severity of damage to consciousness, medical and brain-related effects, and brain activity measurements.
Based on x-rays, medical findings, and blood analyses, the frequency and extent of breathing in blood, vomit, or debris into the lungs and of its effects were measured.
As consciousness decreased, the frequency and extent of breathing in material increased.
Medically and x-ray proven breathing in of fluid occured in 60% of reports of severe head trauma.
Comparing two groups after both received first aid and artificial breathing showed that oxygen was lower in patients with x-ray proven breathing in of fluids in the lungs than unaffected patients.
A relationship exists between the amount inhaled and extent of fluid moved into the lungs.
There was no change in the frequency of breathing in fluids between patients with breathing tubes and those without before arriving to the hospital.
In many cases, while breathing in of blood cannot be stopped after head trauma, prompt use of breathing tubes is the only way to lessen the effects of breathing in fluids and prevent its return.
Breathing in fluids again is a serious risk. For unconscious patients, breathing tubes are a "must".
The study showed that breathing in foreign material into the lungs and the resulting effects can be treated even with severe head trauma.
In no cases studied was death owing to these causes.
Besides adding tubes and removing lung waste, artificial breathing in of oxygen-enriched gases greatly influence breathing-related effects.
