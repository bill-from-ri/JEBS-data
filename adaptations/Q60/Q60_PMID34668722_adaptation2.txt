Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

Rapid diagnostics tests are useful for detecting COVID-19 virus.
Misleading demos of the rapid test on social media showed it can find COVID-19 virus in the tap water and food.
To fight misleading information, we studied the results of the rapid tests that did not follow testing rules. 
We did the test in a wrong way on water, food, other liquids and samples without the COVID-19 virus.
We also studied how different temperatures and humidity change test results. 
Doing the test wrong caused false positive results saying there is COVID-19 virus in the materials that did not have it.
False results may happen because the parts of the test change if the test is done wrong. 

The test changed less in extremes of temperature and humidity.
Our study supports strictly following the test instructions to reduce false positive results of COVID-19 rapid test. False positive results increase anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and spread of rumors.
The Panbio rapid COVID-19 test that we studied is used in over 120 countries worldwide. It is very important to understand how to get accurate test results.
Recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed.
Health professionals know that not doing the tests right causes errors in the results. Knowing what causes the errors will help them explain the errors and stop rumors. 
Many different parts of the test need to work properly to avoid mistakes. 
In many cases, test errors are caused by the chemicals our bodies have to fight other infections or some other chemicals that accidentally got into the test. Our study shows how the parts of the test can cause errors if the test is not done right. 
Following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.
