Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

We aim to find out how accurate the nasal swabs for rapid COVID-19 tests are in a large community with low rates of disease.
Study participants were 18 years and older. They had an appointment for COVID-19 test in March 2021 in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The swabs from their throat and nose were tested. 
We compared the accuracy of the rapid test using a nose swab to the throat test that used a tradiional testing method. 
We had 7074 paired reliable tests of which about half was for females.
The age ranged from 36 to 57 years.
66 traditional throat tests (less than 1 percent) were positive.
For 32 of these, the rapid nasal test was also positive.

We did not have any false positive tests.
Overlooking more than half of the patients with the disease is a problem.
