Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

Positive retests of COVID-19 represent a public health concern because of the increased risk of transmission.
This study explored whether factors other than the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) contribute to positive retest results.
Patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Guanggu district of the Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital between February 17 and March 28, 2020, were retrospectively included.
The patients were grouped into the negative (n = 133) and positive (n = 51) retest groups.
The results showed that the proportion of patients presenting with cough was higher (P < 0.001) and the proportion of patients with dyspnea was lower (P = 0.018) in the positive than in the negative retest group.
The positive retest group showed shorter durations between symptom onset and hospitalization (P < 0.001) and symptom onset and the first positive NAAT (P = 0.033).
The positive retest group had higher basophil counts (P = 0.023) and direct bilirubin (P = 0.032) and chlorine concentrations (P = 0.023) but lower potassium concentrations (P = 0.001) than the negative retest group.
Multivariable regression analysis showed that coughing (OR = 7.59, 95% CI 2.28-25.32, P = 0.001) and serum chloride concentrations (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77, P = 0.010) were independently associated with a positive retest result.
Coughing and serum chloride concentrations were independent risk factors for positive NAAT retest results.
Patients with a hospital stay of < 2 weeks or a short incubation period should stay in isolation and be monitored to reduce transmission.
These results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.
