Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?


It is hard to detect COVID-19 patients in a group of patients with common cold symptoms because there are no COVID-specific symptoms, there are not enough test supplies, and test results can be falsely negative in patients with COVID-19.
We aim to find some strong signs in the COVID test results that show SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We studied 374 patients who got rapid COVID tests.
Patients were 31 to 59 years old, and one tenth of them had positive COVID-19 test results.
Patients who lost their sense pf smell had a higher chance to test positive for COVID-19. Patients with a sore throat had a lower chance to test positive for COVID-19.
Patients who had contact with an infected persons and had symptoms themselves also had an increased chance to test positive.
Even if they did not have symptoms, these patients had higher chances to test positive.
