How safe is the covid vaccine?

Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which is a breathing-related viral illness. Vaccines also protect those at high risk for issues.

This randomized, controlled trial was performed at 99 centers across the United States.
People at high risk for SARS-CoV-2, or Covid-19, infection or its effects were randomly split in a 1:1 ratio to get two injections of the new vaccine or inactive placebo 28 days apart.
The key measure was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior.
The trial had 30,420 volunteers randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the vaccine or inactive placebo (15,210 participants in each group).
More than 96& of participants got both injections. 2.2% had evidence (antibody and/or molecular testing) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start.
185 participants in the inactive placebo group showed symptoms of Covid-19., while11 participants in the vaccine group showed symptoms of Covid-19.
Effectiveness was similar for key secondary analyses like analysis 14 days after the first dose, analysis with participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start, and analysis in participants 65 years or older.
Severe Covid-19 occured in 30 participants, with one death. All 30 were in the inactive placebo group.
Moderate, temporary body reactions after vaccination occured more often in the vaccine group.
Serious, harmful events were rare, and the frequency was similar in the two groups.
The vaccine showed 94.1% success at preventing Covid-19, including severe disease.
Aside from temporary local and full-body reactions, no safety concerns were found.
