How safe is the covid vaccine?

There are reports of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting and infection) of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis, after vaccination for Covid-19 (a viral lung infection).
Researchers reviewed all hospitalized military personnel in the Isareli Defense Forces during the period of the Covid-19 vaccination  (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for confirmed cases of myocarditis.
Researchers found 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of Covid-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
One case of myocarditis diagnosed 10 days after the second dose of the vaccine is not included.
These 8 cases are all events of myocarditis diagnosed in military personnel during this time period.
All patients are young and generally healthy.
All have a mild case of the disease with no long-lasting effects.
The number of myocarditis in the week following a second dose of the vaccine is 5.07 out of 100,000 people vaccinated.
Due to the nature of this report, no deaths can be established.
Medical providers should be aware of the possibility of myocarditis following Pfizer vaccination.
The true number of occurrence of myocarditis among people receiving the vaccine should be further investigated.
