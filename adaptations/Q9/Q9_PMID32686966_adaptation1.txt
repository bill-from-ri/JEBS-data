How to dislodge meat from throat?

The study aimed to look at the use of a camera on the tip of a curved blade to diagnose and remove objects in the throat that shouldnâ€™t be eaten.
We studied 1572 people who had objects in the throat that shouldn't be eaten.
We wrote down the time between eating the object and coming to the hospital, age, gender, how long the patient was in the hospital, and where the object was stuck.
The most common objects stuck were fish bones, which made up 1446 (91.98%) of 1572 objects.
Among all 1572 objects, 1004 (63.87%) were successfully removed using a camera on the tip of a curved blade without problems.
When a camera on the tip of a curved blade was used to diagnose the object, people left the hospital sooner.
Diagnosing sharp objects was higher than that of non-sharp objects.
The most common place that objects were stuck in the throat were the far back and bottom of the tongue (42.29%), the space between the back of the tongue and the windpipe entrance (19.40%), the tonsil (18.21%), and the bottom of the throat (10.65%).
We conclude that using a camera on the tip of a curved blade is a strong tool for the diagnosis and removal of objects in the throat that shouldn't be eaten, allowing for the finding of uncommon locations of objects and of objects not easily removed.
