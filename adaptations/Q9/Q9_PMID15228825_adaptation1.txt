How to dislodge meat from throat?

Our objective is to rate treatment of objects that shouldn't be eaten found in the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine.
We included 103 patients who ate objects that shouldn't be eaten.
Neck x-rays and a procedure that uses a stiff, inflexible tube with a camera were done to diagnose and remove the objects that shouldn't be eaten.
We recorded all information using a questionnaire.
Trouble swallowing (92%) and soreness in neck (60%) were the most common symptoms.
Most of the patients (89%) had come to the hospital within 24 hours.
X-rays of the side of the neck helped the most with air in the esophagus being an important finding.
The part of the throat that allows food to pass into the esophagus was where objects that shouldn't be eaten got stuck in 84% of people.
Using a flexible tube with a camera worked in 90 patients (97%) and didn't work in 3 patients (3%).
Coins were swallowed most often (60%), followed by meat (22.5%) and dentures (5%).
Complications happened in 18% of patients and were more common in adults (37.1%) compared to children (8.8%).
The most serious complication was air in the center of the chest.
People who swallowed dentures (80%) and bone chips (42%) had the most complications.
We concluded that objects in the esophagus that shouldn't be eaten are a serious condition and early removal by inserting a flexible tube with a camera is safe and works.
