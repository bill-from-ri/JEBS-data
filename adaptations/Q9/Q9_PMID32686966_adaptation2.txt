How to dislodge meat from throat?

This work explored the use of video viewing of the voice box with a small device to identify and treat throat foreign bodies (FBs) or substances.
1572 total patients with throat foreign substances at the Department of Otolarynology of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were analysed.
Time from foreign substance consumption to hospital admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of blockage were measured.
The most common foreign substance was fish bones, seen in  91.98% of patients.
Among all 1572 foreign substances, 1004 (63.87%) were removed by video throat treatment with a small device without issues.
A shorter hospital stay was linked to higher identification rate by video viewing of the voice box with a small device.
The identification rate of sharp foreign substances was higher than that of non-sharp ones.
The most common sites of throat foreign substances were areas near the tonsil and bottom of the tongue and throat.
Video viewing of the voice box with a small device is powerful for identifying and treating throat foreign substances. It allows identification of rare locations of foreign substances and stubborn ones.
