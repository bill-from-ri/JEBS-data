How to dislodge meat from throat?

Objects that shouldn't be found in the ear, nose, and throat can be removed in the emergency room, especially if the information the patient provides lines up with an object that shouldn't be in the body and the patient is calm and agreeable with the exam and efforts to remove the object.
Tips for success include painkillers, the ability to see the object, keeping the patient's head still, skill and experience of the doctor, and removing the object with the least number of tries.
It is very important to realize the risks involved with certain objects (button batteries or sharp objects) and when to call a specialist to help ensure safe, successful removal of objects to the ear, nose, and throat.
