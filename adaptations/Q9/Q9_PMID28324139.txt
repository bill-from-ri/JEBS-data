How to dislodge meat from throat?

Most swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment depends on the type of dysphagia.
A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, phoniatrists, and speech-language therapists is necessary to develop the appropriate treatment strategy.
A thorough medical history, clinical investigation of the swallowing muscles, and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with foods of different consistencies help to decide whether swallowing exercises alone are sufficient, or whether an additional pharmacologic or surgical treatment is needed to prevent aspiration, malnutrition, and dehydration.
