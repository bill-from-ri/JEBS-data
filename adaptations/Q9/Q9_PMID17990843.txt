How to dislodge meat from throat?

Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat are occasionally seen in family medicine, usually in children.
The most common foreign bodies are food, plastic toys, and small household items.
Diagnosis is often delayed because the causative event is usually unobserved, the symptoms are nonspecific, and patients often are misdiagnosed initially.
Most ear and nose foreign bodies can be removed by a skilled physician in the office with minimal risk of complications.
Common removal methods include use of forceps, water irrigation, and suction catheter.
Pharyngeal or tracheal foreign bodies are medical emergencies requiring surgical consultation.
Radiography results are often normal.
Flexible or rigid endoscopy usually is required to confirm the diagnosis and to remove the foreign body.
Physicians need to have a high index of suspicion for foreign bodies in children with unexplained upper airway symptoms.
It is important to understand the anatomy and the indications for subspecialist referral.
The evidence is inadequate to make strong recommendations for specific removal techniques.
