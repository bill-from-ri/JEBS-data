How to dislodge meat from throat?

Most swallowing problems can be treated, but the treatment depends on the type of swallowing difficulty.
A multi-type team of surgeons, speech-related organ specialists, and speech-language therapists is needed to create appropriate treatment.
A clear medical history, swallowing muscle examination, and monitoring with small devices of swallowing of food with various textures help decide if swallowing exercises alone or additional drug or surgical treatment is needed to prevent breathing, eating, and hydration issues.
