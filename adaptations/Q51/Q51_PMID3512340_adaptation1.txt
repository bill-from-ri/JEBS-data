What is islet cell antibody group?

A lab-made islet cell antibody (proteins made against insulin-producing cells), HISL-19, that reacts with clusters of cells that produce hormones in the sugar-regulating pancreas of the human, cow, and pig has been used to find and describe a new group of islet (pancreatic) cell proteins (p120, p69, p67, and p56).
HISL-19 is also reactive with other related tissues that can be grouped into a new family of neuroendocrine (cells like nerve cells that make hormones) molecules.
