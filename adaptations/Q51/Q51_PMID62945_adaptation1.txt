What is islet cell antibody group?

We found pancreatic islet-cell antibodies (I.C.Ab; proteins made against insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) in 31 patients with disorders where the body's defense system attacks certain organs; 4 parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab-positive diabetes, and 1 apparently normal person, none of whom had symptoms of diabetes.
Of these 36 people, glucose (sugar molecule)-tolerance tests (G.T.T.S) showed 10 had diabetes, 4 had lag storage (normal glucose levels spike and return to normal), and 22 had normal results. Two people had latent diabetes (slow progressing with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) while pregnant and thyrotoxicosis (too much metabolism-regulating thyroid hormone in the body) and another 2 later developed type 1 diabetes.
Blood from 26 people had been stored for 1-11 years before we did the oral (by mouth) tests that measures the body's response to sugar (glucose).
I.C.Ab measurements rose and fell in some patients and stayed constant in other patients.
No relationship existed between the measurement, change in measurement, or the length of I.C.Ab or the presence of antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) and the G.T.T. result.
I.C.Ab in the blood can indicate diabetes without symptoms and slow-progressing diabetes and prediabetes and may signal a new group of possible diabetics with normal G.T.T.S.
Many possible diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. have at least one disorder where the body's defense system attacks certain organs (regardless of family history of diabetes), but some are parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab (mainly type 1 diabetes).
About 0-5% of the general population also have I.C.Ab in their blood.
