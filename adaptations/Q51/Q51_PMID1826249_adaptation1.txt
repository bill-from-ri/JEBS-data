What is islet cell antibody group?

Checking all people with diabetes detected later in life for islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) may help predict dependence on insulin.
We read doctor notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ICA positive (with ICA) over a 9-year checking period to determine what role ICA status made to their treatment.
Forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and half after up to 6 years).
Of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on health diet and seven were on oral (by mouth) medication after about 3 years.
In 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started due to observable symptoms (high levels of blood acids called ketones, high levels of ketones in urine, weight loss, and/or serious symptoms) rather than issues related to the body's defense system.
Five patients were started on insulin due to ICA status where no observable symptoms existed.
Doctors were hesitant to send home 7 non-insulin-treated, ICA-positive patients.
The data suggest that regularly estimating ICA in this age group is not needed, as the decision to treat with insulin should be based on observable symptoms, and ICF estimation can cause unneeded insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors due to a positive result.
