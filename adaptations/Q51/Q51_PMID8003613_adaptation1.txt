What is islet cell antibody group?

Type 1 diabetes is associated with the formation of self-made proteins against different toxins in the islets of Langerhans (a group of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas), known as islet cell antibodies (ICA).
The expression of a major self-made marker, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD; substance found only in insulin-producing cells), depends on glucose (sugar) levels and is related to insulin release when observed in a test tube.
We looked at expression of islet self-made markers in pancreatic cells and tested the relationship between beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) function and islet cell surface antibody (ICSA) reactivity.
We fed rats glipizide or diazoxide (insulin-treating drugs) for 10 days to increase or decrease insulin release, respectively.
Sections of the pancreas were analyzed.

We saw the highest measurements in rats given glipizide.
We saw medium measurements in animals not given drugs, and the lowest measurements in rats given diazoxide.
Opposite to these findings, we could not show a relationship between ICSA reactivity and islet cell activity.
Conflicting results concerning ICSA in previous reports and our failure to show an energy regulation of ICSA reactivity, indicate that ICSA is a phenomenon with a low degree of specific detection.
