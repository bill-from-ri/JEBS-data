What does duloxetine do?

A rare side effect of taking antidepressant drugs is uncontrollable movement, also called movement disorders.
There may be different side effects depending on what antidepressant drugs you take.
This study tried to figure out which antidepressant drugs caused which movement disorder side effects.
This study looked at reports of antidepressant use from 1967 to 2017 using a computer database.
This study used statistics to see if the links between the different antidepressants and movement disorders.
There were over 14 million reports in the database. One million of those contained a report of antidepressant use. Almost 30 thousand of the antidepressant reports contained a movement disorder side effect.
The patients in the reports ranged from 32-68 years old and contained twice as many women as men.
All movement disorders were linked to antidepressant use. Jaw clenching was seen the most often, and involuntary movement called tics were the least seen.
The anitdepressant drug class called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) were most often linked to movement disorders except for restless leg syndrome.
The antidepressants linked to the strongest movement disorders, like Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, were mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amoxapine, phenelzine, tryptophan, and fluvoxamine. The antidepressants with the most movement disorder side effects were citalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine.
Eight other antidepressants were linked to movement disorder side effects.
This study found that movement disorder side effects were linked to the antidepressants mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amoxapine, phenelzine, tryptophan, fluvoxamine, citalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, bupropion, clomipramine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, mianserin, sertraline, venlafaxine, and vilazodone.
Doctors should be aware of side effects and watch patients on antidepresants carefully.
This study is introductory and should be furthered explored with more studies.
