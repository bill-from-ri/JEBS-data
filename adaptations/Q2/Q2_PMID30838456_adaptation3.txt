What does duloxetine do?

This chapter talks about the antidepressant drugs that are called serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors.

Duloxetine is a strong version of the 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor type.
The way that duloxetine works means that doctors will have to watch you closely and may have to adjust your dose if you are taking certain types of other drugs.
Duloxetine's side effects include upset stomach, dry mouth, dizzy spells, constipation, high blood pressure, and loss of sleep and energy.
Studies show that duloxetine treats depression just as well as other drugs.
In addition to treating depression, duloxetine may be given to you to treat pain such as pain caused by diabetes and other body pains.
Drugs in the 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor class can make you very sick if taken with drugs that are in the MAOI class of antidepressants.
