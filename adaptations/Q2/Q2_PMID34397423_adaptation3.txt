What does duloxetine do?

Children with depression or anxiety have a higher risk of suicide and aggressive and anxious behavior when taking antidepressants. 
This study wants to find out if healthy teens have a higher risk of suicide and other bad thoughts when taking antidepressants for reasons other than depression.
This study looks at data from another study where teens with chronic pain known as fibromyalgia were treated with an antidepressant called duloxetine.
The study defined severe side effects as suicidal and other bad thoughts and anything that stopped the patient from taking the drug.
The study found that a large number of teens in the study had suicidal thoughts and other side effects when treated with duloxetine. Teens that were not taking the drug did not have these side effects.
Many more instances of severe side effects occurred for teens taking duloxetine as opposed to those not taking the drug.
Teens may be at risk of suicide and other bad thoughts when taking the drug duloxetine even if the drug is not being used to treat depression or anxiety.
