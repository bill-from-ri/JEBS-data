What does duloxetine do?

We present a case of hypertensive urgency in a diabetic patient with painful diabetic neuropathy on duloxetine treatment.
The patient's blood pressure was high after taking 1-day dose of duloxetine and the patient was diagnosed with hypertensive urgency.
The patient was treated with labetalol, leading to reduction in blood pressure.
The patient's medication was switched to telmisartan and metoprolol, which leads to resolution of increased blood pressure.
This case report is a possible case of hypertensive urgency after the initiation of duloxetine managed with antihypertensives and resolves with the discontinuation of the duloxetine.
