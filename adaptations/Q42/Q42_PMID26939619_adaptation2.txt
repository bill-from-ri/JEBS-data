What are the types of histone proteins?

Histones are proteins that bind to and influence DNA expression.
However, histones are also located both inside and outside the cell away from DNA to defend the host and promote inflammation.
Histones help certain immune cells kill bacteria but also lead to injury from inflammation.
Histones can also directly kill microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses inside and outside the host body.
Also, histones can trigger inflammation by contacting certain target sites or pathways.
Histones outside of cell influence organ injury (lung, liver), sepsis (life-threatening self-attack from immune cells due to an infection), low count of blood platelet (which help make blood clots), and blood clot generation. Some proteins can bind and block these possibly harmful actions of histones.
