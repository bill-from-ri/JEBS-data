What are the types of histone proteins?

Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed.
At first, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins, but later it was discovered that they act outside of cells as a powerful antimicrobial, an agent that can kill microorganisms or stop their growth. They may also be self-destructive agents.
Histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) and highlighted their microbicidal function that kills microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses.
Also, histones outside of cells proved to be involved in triggering worsening inflammatory (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection) and blood clotting responses, depending on the cell type affected.
Because of this, several investigations were conducted to study the potential of histones and the substances they may produce as either a sign of a normal or abnormal process in the body (biomarkers or signalers of normal or abnormal processes) or possible ways to use them to fight different diseases.
The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the most up to date and advanced information on the beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and treatments.
