How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister-Hall syndrome was first identified in unearthed human remains. 
The first two bodies had unusual features including a brain mass, missing anus, a sixth finger in the center, and death after birth.

As more cases were found, it became clear that PHS is not such a rare disorder.
Shortly after, it was recognized that the disease runs in the families due to changes in the gene called GLI3.
Other problems can be caused by changes in the same gene GLI3. Different changes in the different parts of the gene cause different problems.
