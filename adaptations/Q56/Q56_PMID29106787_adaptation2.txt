How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister Hall syndrome is passed down by one of the parents. It is usually diagnosed in infants and children.
It is diagnosed if it runs in the family, and the children have hypothalamic hamartoma (a non-cancer growth of tissues in the brain), and extra fingers or toes, but these are not the only signs of the disease. 
We diagnosed Pallister Hall syndrome in a family where both patients were adults.
A 59 year old man developed seizures 4 years before we examined him. An imaging examination showed a hypothalamic hamartoma.
The seizures were under control.
He did well until he had changes in eyesight after a head injury. 
MRI showed the mass has expanded slightly and the patient's vision was missing in the outer half of both the right and left eye. 
There were no signs of problems with the hormones made in the pituitary gland (which maintain body functions), except for large amount of urine. 
The patient had surgery to reduce the hamartoma and his vision improved.
After the surgery, the pituitary gland functioned normally, and the patient no longer was excessively thirsty. 
His 29 year old daughter also had seizures and hypothalamic hamartoma.
Both patients had surgery to remove the extra fingers in childhood.
The daughter had genetic testing that showed she had a variant that caused the disease. 
Many family members in previous generations had extra fingers and seizures.
Pallister-Hall syndrome is caused by either parent passing down the disease or a new harmful change in the genes. 
It is not known how many people have this rare disease.
Generally, the disease is recognized in children. 
We described some of the few cases detected in adults.
