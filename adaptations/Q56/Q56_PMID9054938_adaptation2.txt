How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) was first described in 1980 in six newborns.
It is caused by a single gene that is involved in development of multiple body parts. The problems include a non-cancer mass in the lower part of the brain and extra fingers and toes, among others.
This disorder is passed down by either parent, and the involved gene is located on chromosome 7, associating PHS with the gene called GLI3.
Variants of the the GLI3 gene in which some genetic information is missing or misplaced are associated with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) that affects development of the hands, feet, head, and face.
Patients with both PHS and GCPS have extra or merged fingers and toes, and abnormal heads and faces. Both PHS and GCPS are passed down from either parent, but the clinical signs of these diseases are different. 
The additional finger in GCPS is usually located next to the thumb. In PHS, the extra finger is in the center or next to the little finger (pinky). The extra toes follow the same pattern: in GCPS the sixth toe is next to the big toe. 
No reported cases of GCPS have non-cancer growth in the lower part of the brain, and PHS does not cause increased distance between the eyes or broadening of the nose or forehead. 
Because the generic changes for PHS and GCPS share the location on the chromosome, we study GLI3 as a gene potentially responsible for PHS.
We describe two PHS families with large changes in the GLI3 gene. In one family the change is new and there is no family history of PHS.
The data show that changes in the GLI3 gene, which are passed down in the family or happen for the first time, cause PHS. Large-scale  changes in the GLI3 gene can change the development of  many tissues and organs.
