How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

We report on three infants born with hands born with hand defects and defects of the pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth through chemical substances called hormones. 
Two of the newborns had hypothalamic tumors (noncancerous growths in the base of their brains). The brain of the third newborn was not examined.
In one case, the disease runs in the family. The mother's sister died at the age of 17. She had extra fingers, extremely small tongue, and flat nose.
The mother of the second newborn had very low levels of estriol, a hormone made during pregnancy that is used to measure the unborn baby's health.
When this baby was born, brain imaging was normal, but the levels of hormones that regulate growth and development were low. Treatment with growth and other hormones was started. 
At 11.5 months the baby started having seizures. A new brain imaging showed a mass in the lower part of the brain.
Surgery to remove this mass at 12 months was the first successful treatment of this disorder.
The third newborn had a split in the flap that protects the windpipe, lack of hormones that regulate growth and development, and abnormal hands.
Brain imaging at birth did not show a mass in the lower part of the brain. 
This child died from complications of a brain mass that was not showing in the image. 
These three babies were conceived between March 10th and April 17th in three different years in three neighboring counties of Vermont.
Close locations and possible other PHS cases in one of these families suggest inheritance and environment might interact.
