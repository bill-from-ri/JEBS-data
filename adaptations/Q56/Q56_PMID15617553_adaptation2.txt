How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disease caused by changes in a single gene (the basic unit of inheritance.) The abnormalities include extra fingers and toes, growth of non-cancer masses in the brain, changes in the flap that protect the windpipe, improper function of the endocrine system that regulates body functions through hormones, and other problems.
The signs of this disease vary and are passed down through either parent. 
We studied if PHS causes any mental health problems. 
We measured how well the brain is working in 19 PHS patients ranging in age from 7 to 75 years.
The evaluation included clinical examination, patients' reports and tests of brain functions. 
Seven of 14 adults had at least one of the mental health conditions most commonly found in the public.
Three other patients had delays in mental development or low scores on the tests that measure how well the brain is working. The tests usually evaluate reading, use of language, attention, learning, reasoning, remembering, problem-solving, and more.
We did not find mental health problems specifically associated with PHS. The frequency of each of the problems in these patients was the same as expected in the group of 19 people.
The rate of mental problems in PHS cannot be compared to the overall rate of mental problems in the general population because of the way this study collected the data.
