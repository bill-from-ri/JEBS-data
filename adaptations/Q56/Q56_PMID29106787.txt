How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister Hall syndrome is autosomal dominant disorder usually diagnosed in infants and children.
Current diagnostic criteria include presence of hypothalamic hamartoma, post axial polydactyly and positive family history, but the disease has variable manifestations.
Herein we report Pallister Hall syndrome diagnosed in a family where both patients were adults.
A 59 year old man developed seizures 4 years prior to our evaluation of him, at which time imaging showed a hypothalamic hamartoma.
The seizures were controlled medically.
He did well until he had visual changes after a traumatic head injury.
Repeat MRI showed slight expansion of the mass with formal visual field testing demonstrating bitemporal hemianopsia.
There was no evidence of pituitary dysfunction except for large urine volume.
He underwent surgery to debulk the hamartoma and the visual field defects improved.
There was no hypopituitarism post-operatively, and the polydyspia resolved.
His 29 year old daughter also had seizures and hypothalamic hamartoma.
Both patients had had polydactyly with prior surgical correction in childhood.
The daughter underwent genetic testing, which revealed a previously undescribed heterozygous single base pair deletion in exon 13 of the GLI3 gene causing a frameshift mutation.
Further investigation into family history revealed multiple members in previous generations with polydactyly and/or seizures.
Pallister-Hall syndrome is caused by an inherited autosomal dominant or de novo mutation in GLI3 gene.
This rare syndrome has not had prevalence defined, however.
Generally, diagnoses are made in the pediatric population.
Our report adds to the few cases detected in adulthood.
