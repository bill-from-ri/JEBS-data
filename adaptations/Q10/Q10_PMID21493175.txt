I have a cut on my arm and my fingers are sweating and i feel pain in my fingers. What can i do to stop the pain?

Objective: To identify through case study the presentation and possible pathophysiological cause of complex regional pain syndrome and its preferential response to stellate ganglion blockade.
Setting: Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances.
Pathophysiology is likely to involve peripheral and central components and neurological and inflammatory elements.
There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved.
Diagnosis can be difficult, with over-diagnosis resulting from undue emphasis placed upon pain disproportionate to an inciting event despite the absence of other symptoms or under-diagnosed when subtle symptoms are not recognised.
The International Association for the Study of Pain supports the use of sympathetic blocks to reduce sympathetic nervous system overactivity and relieve complex regional pain symptoms.
Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial.
Three blocks were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and sterile conditions.
Physiotherapeutic input was delivered under block conditions to maximise joint and tissue mobility and facilitate restoration of function.
Conclusion: This case demonstrates the need for practitioners from all disciplines to be able to identify the clinical characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome to instigate immediate treatment and supports the notion that stellate ganglion blockade is preferable to upper limb intravenous regional anaesthetic block for refractory index finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.
