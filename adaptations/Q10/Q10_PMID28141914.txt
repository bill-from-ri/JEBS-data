Background: Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease that may lead to pain, stiffness and problems in performing hand-related activities of daily living.
Currently, no cure for OA is known, and non-pharmacological modalities are recommended as first-line care.
A positive effect of exercise in hip and knee OA has been documented, but the effect of exercise on hand OA remains uncertain.
Authors' conclusions: When we pooled results from five studies, we found low-quality evidence showing small beneficial effects of exercise on hand pain, function and finger joint stiffness.
Estimated effect sizes were small, and whether they represent a clinically important change may be debated.
One study reported quality of life, and the effect is uncertain.
Three studies reported on adverse events, which were very few and were not severe.
