I have a cut on my arm and my fingers are sweating and i feel pain in my fingers. What can i do to stop the pain?

When a patient has sudden or ongoing hand and/or finger pain after an injury, a hand therapist may place a pencil over and under the first bone of the finger (that starts at the base from the hand) that is causing the pain.
The doctor will then ask the patient to flex and extend the fingers several times.
Putting the first knuckle (the joint where the finger connects with the hand) in a more flexed and extended position than the other knuckles will often take away the pain with active movement when the pencil is in place.
The hand therapist will then build a relative motion splint (a piece of sturdy material to support injured bones and allow some movement) that will have the same effect of the pencil.
These types of splints support initial movement and can be worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Most people can work with these splints on.
