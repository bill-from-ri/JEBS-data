Hand osteoarthritis is a common joint disease that may lead to pain, stiffness and problems in performing hand-related activities of daily living.
Currently, no cure for osteoarthritis is known, and using treatment methods that do not involve medications for pain are recommended as first-line care.
A positive effect of exercise in hip and knee osteoarthritis has been documented, but the effect of exercise on hand osteoarthritis remains uncertain.
Researchers reviewed results from 5 studies and found low-quality evidence (the findings are difficult to interpret or are considered weak) showing small helpful effects of exercise on hand pain, function and finger joint stiffness.
The relationship between hand osteoarthritis and exercise were small in these studies, and it is not clear if any medical practices should change based on these 5 studies.
One study reported quality of life, and the effect is uncertain.
Three studies reported on unexpected medical problems, which were very few and were not severe.
