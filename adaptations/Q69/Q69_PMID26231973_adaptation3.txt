What are prevention suggestions and strategies pertaining to postpartum depression?

Most treatments to prevent depression after giving birth, postpartum depression (PPD), focus on the mother instead of the total relationship between mother and infant.
Research showed strong relationships between infant sleep and cry behavior and mother's mood after childbirth. Interventions focusing on the relationship between mother and infant (mother-infant dyad) may reduce PPD.
This study examines the success of the PREPP (Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum Parenting) intervention. 
PREPP is a new PPD prevention program that treats women at risk for PPD. This intervention teaches skills to help mothers themselves as well as skills to help make changes in their infant's behavior.
This study showed that this new and brief intervention was accepted well and successful in reducing maternal symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly at 6 weeks postpartum (after childbirth).
This study found that infants of mothers in the PREPP program had fewer bouts of fussing and crying at 6 weeks postpartum compared to infants whose mothers were in another group, (the Enhanced TAU group).
These early results show that PREPP  may be able to reduce PPD in women at risk and to directly affect the developing mother-child relationship, the mother's view of her child, and child outcomes.
