What are prevention suggestions and strategies pertaining to postpartum depression?

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health problem affecting 10-57% of adolescent mothers which can affect not only adolescent mothers but also their infants.
Thus, there is a need for interventions to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers.
However, recent systematic reviews have been focused on effective interventions to prevent PPD in adult mothers.
These interventions may not necessarily be applicable for adolescent mothers.
Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of the existing interventions to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers.
A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases between January 2000 and March 2017 with English language and studies involving human subjects.
Studies reporting on the outcomes of intervention to prevent PPD particularly in adolescent mothers were selected.
Non-comparative studies were excluded.
From 2002 identified records, 13 studies were included, reporting on 2236 adolescent pregnant women.
The evidence from this systematic review suggests that 6 of 13 studies from both psychological and psychosocial interventions including (1) home-visiting intervention, (2) prenatal antenatal and postnatal educational program, (3) CBT psycho-educational, (4) the REACH program based on interpersonal therapy, and (5) infant massage training is successful in reducing rates of PPD symptoms in adolescent mothers in the intervention group than those mothers in the control group.
These interventions might be considered for incorporation in antenatal care interventions for adolescent pregnant women.
However, this review did not find evidence identifying the most effective intervention for preventing postpartum depression symptoms in adolescent mothers.
