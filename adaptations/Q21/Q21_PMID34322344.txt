How do you check for a hernia?

Internal hernias are rare, and a delayed diagnosis can lead to dangerous complications.
A 75-year-old male with no previous surgical history presented with right upper abdominal pain and vomiting.
On examination, he had guarding in the right hypochondrium with a positive Murphy's sign.
However, ultrasonography of the gall bladder was normal with dilated bowel loops.
Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) revealed a falciform hernia with evidence of obstruction.
Segmental resection of the gangrenous ileum was done with a double-barrel stoma.
Later on, stoma reversal was also done with no complications.
