How do you check for a hernia?

A Spigelian hernia (or lateral ventral hernia involving bulging of digestive organs) develops through muscles found in the abdominal wall.
So far, about 1000 of these hernia cases have been seen worldwide.
These hernias are hard to diagnose, because they do not cause swelling and often can cut off blood supply to one or more essential organs (e.g., small or large intestine).
We look at the case of a 36-year-old female with a history of pain and lumpiness in her left lower stomach, both of which got better when she lay down.
She came to the emergency room with severe pain at the same place that went away on its own.
A CT scan showed a Spigelian hernia, and a doctor performed surgery.
Spigelian hernias are rare and often can cut off blood supply to one or more essential organs.
Knowledge of symptoms and signs is important to diagnose and treat these rare hernias.
