How do you check for a hernia?

Purpose: Hiatal hernias are a common finding on radiographic or endoscopic studies.
Hiatal hernias may become symptomatic or, less frequently, can incarcerate or become a volvulus leading to organ ischemia.
This review examines latest evidence on the diagnostic workup and management of hiatal hernias.
Methods: A literature review of contemporary and latest studies with highest quality of evidence was completed.
This information was examined and compiled in review format.
Results: Asymptomatic hiatal and paraesophageal hernias become symptomatic and necessitate repair at a rate of 1% per year.
Watchful waiting is appropriate for asymptomatic hernias.
Symptomatic hiatal hernias and those with confirmed reflux disease require operative repair with an anti-reflux procedure.
Key operative steps include the following: reduction and excision of hernia sac, 3 cm of intraabdominal esophageal length, crural closure with mesh reinforcement, and an anti-reflux procedure.
Repairs not amenable to key steps may undergo gastropexy and gastrostomy placement as an alternative procedure.
Conclusions: Hiatal hernias are commonly incidental findings.
When hernias become symptomatic or have reflux disease, an operative repair is required.
A minimally invasive approach is safe and has improved outcomes.
