How do you check for a hernia?

Richter's hernia, also called a partial enterocele, involves a protrusion of peritoneum with subsequent strangulation or incarceration of only part of the lumen of the anti-mesenteric portion of the small bowel through a fascial defect.
We report a rare presentation of incarcerated incisional Richter's hernia of the cecum in a 39-year-old female.
The patient presented with acute abdominal pain that gradually improved.
Physical examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness and nodularity just above an abdominoplasty scar.
Subsequent computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1 cm by 1 cm hypovascular pocket arising from the cecum with protrusion into the anterior abdominal wall.
The hernia was successfully repaired surgically with resolution of symptoms.
It is essential for clinicians to be mindful of the diagnosis of Richter's hernia on the differential for abdominal pain as the risk of detrimental outcomes increases with delayed surgical intervention.
