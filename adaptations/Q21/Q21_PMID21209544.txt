How do you check for a hernia?

A Spigelian hernia (or lateral ventral hernia) is a hernia through the spigelian fascia, which is the aponeurotic layer between the rectus abdominis muscle medially, and the semilunar line laterally.
So far, about 1000 cases have been reported worldwide.
These hernias are difficult to diagnose as they do not present with a subcutaneous swelling and have high risk of going for strangulation.
We discuss the case of a 36 year old female who presented with history of pain and lumpiness in left lower abdomen, both of which decreased on lying down.
She presented to emergency with an episode severe pain at same site which subsided spontaneously.
Diagnosis was confirmed on CT scan, plication and onlay prolene mesh repair performed.
Spigelian hernias are rare, interparietal type of hernias which have high risk undergoing strangulation.
Knowledge of symptoms and signs is vital to diagnosis and treatment of these rare type of hernias.
