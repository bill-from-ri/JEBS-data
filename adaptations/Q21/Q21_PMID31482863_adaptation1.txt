How do you check for a hernia?

Inguinal hernia, a bulging of digestive organs occurring in the groin area, is the most often diagnosed hernia. During their lifetime one third of males are diagnosed with an inguinal hernia.
People are most likely to get an inguinal hernia in childhood and after 50 years old.
Doctors usually diagnose an inguinal hernia by a lump in the groin region although some patients can have blocked intestines.
Inguinal hernia repair is the only treatment and is one of the most common surgeries done.
Surgery is usually non-urgent and done under anesthesia.
The repair involves strengthening the area of the groin, often using a plastic mesh; either by traditional or minimally invasive surgery.
The most common complications after a hernia repair are the hernia returning and long-term discomfort, but the rate of a hernia returning has gone down with the use of mesh and minimally invasive surgery.
