How do you check for a hernia?

Hiatus hernia refers to when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest.
The most common type (type 1 or sliding hiatus hernia), looseness of the ligament that attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm, causes the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus to push up.
Sliding hiatus hernia is easily diagnosed by a swallowing test during x-ray, a flexible tube with a light and camera attached, or an esophagus test when more than 2 cm along an axis.
However, the movement of the junction between the esophagus and stomach doesn't allow for dependable detection of smaller abnormalities using a flexible tube with a light and camera attached or x-ray.
Detecting lesser separation between the esophagus and the diaphragm can only be done reliably with a high-resolution esophagus test, which allows a real time location of the parts of the junction between the esophagus and stomach without misrepresentation due to movement.
