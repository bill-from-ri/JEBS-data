How do you check for a hernia?

Internal organ (e.g., stomach) bulging is rare. Delayed identification can lead to dangerous issues.
A 75-year-old male patient with no prior surgeries had right upper ab pain and vomiting.
He had tension in the upper right ab area with pain in the same area.
However, medical imaging of the gall bladder was normal with bloated bowel loops.
Enhanced X-rays showed a possibly obstructing bulge of the ligament connecting the liver to the abdomen wall.
The dead part of the small intestine was surgically removed, while an alternate intestinal pathway was temporarily created and used.
Later, the alternate, temporary, intestinal pathway was reversed without any issue.
