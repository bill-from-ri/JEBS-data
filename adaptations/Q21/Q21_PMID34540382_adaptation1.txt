How do you check for a hernia?

Richter's hernia, also called a partial enterocele, occurs when the tissue that lines your abdominal wall pushes out through a weak point or tear and traps or cuts off blood supply to only one side of one part of the small bowel.
We report a rare case of Richter's hernia trapped at the area of a healing surgical scar at the first part of the small intestine in a 39-year-old female.
The patient had sudden and sharp stomach pain that gradually got better.
Physical exam showed tenderness in the lower right corner of the stomach and nodules just above a tummy tuck scar.
A CT scan showed a 1 cm by 1 cm area with a small number of blood vessels coming from the first part of the small intestine pushing into the front abdominal wall.
Surgery to repair the hernia worked, and symptoms went away.
Doctors must consider the diagnosis of Richter's hernia as a cause of abdominal pain since the risk of harmful effects goes up with delayed surgery.
