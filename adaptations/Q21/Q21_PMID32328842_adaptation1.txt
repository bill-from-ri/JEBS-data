How do you check for a hernia?

We aimed to find which diagnostic tool (CT, MRI, or ultrasound) is more accurate for detection and no detection in diagnosing a hernia (bulging of organs) in the groin area and sub-type (direct or indirect; based on location within the groin).
Results showed that ultrasound was better than CT and MRI in accuracy for detection and no detection in diagnosing a hernia in the groin region.
Results showed ultrasound and CT were very accurate for detection and no detection in diagnosing type of hernia.
We found that ultrasound was the most accurate for detection and no detection.
One must remember that the expertise level of the person using the diagnostic tool can determine how well the tool works.
Based on this review, ultrasound may be the best option when physical exam is uncertain, given that ultrasound is done acceptably at the local level.
