How do you check for a hernia?

Acute traumatic abdominal wall hernia (TAWH) is a rare type of hernia that happens when the stomach wall hits a smooth object at low or high speed with few cases reported.
Tears in the stomach wall that allow stomach contents to spill out often result from stomach injury and likely require surgery for bleeding and controlling the source of the body's extreme response to the spillage.
We report a case where a high-speed impact of the stomach wall against a tree stump caused a TAWH with stomach tearing in a 20-year-old man who needed abdominal surgery and repair of the wound.
The physical exam, no history of stomach hernia, and air in the stomach suggested TAWH, which was confirmed during surgery.
The patient had a strong stomach wall 3 months after surgery.
It is important to not rule out TAWH based on the physical exam.
