Why do blood sugars become elevated in the afternoon?

Afternoon napping is a common habit in China.
Researchers use data obtained from an existing study to examine if duration of regular afternoon napping is associated with risks for impaired fasting (no food and/or water for a period of time) plasma (blood) glucose (pre-diabetes) and diabetes in a Chinese elderly population.
A total of 27,009 participants undergo a physical examination, lab tests, and face-to-face interview.
They are placed into groups based on nap duration. The groups are: no napping, less than 30 minutes, 30 to less than 60 minutes, 60 to less than 90 minutes, and 90 minutes or more.
Statistical analyses are used to examine the odds of napping duration with getting pre-diabetes and diabetes.
Of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps.
Those with longer naps have much higher numbers of pre-diabetes and diabetes.
Napping duration is associated (linked) with pre-diabetes and diabetes.
After adjusting the analysis to account for things that impact the results, longer nap duration (>60 minutes) is still significantly associated with increased risk for pre-diabetes. Also, longer nap duration (>30 minutes) is associated with increased risk for diabetes; however, this finding is not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 minutes.
In conclusion, longer habitual afternoon napping is associated with a moderate increase for diabetes risk.
This finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a new risk factor for diabetes and higher blood sugar levels.
