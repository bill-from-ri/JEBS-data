Why do blood sugars become elevated in the afternoon?

The aim of this study is to examine whether mild early time-restricted eating (eating dinner at 6:00pm vs. at 9:00pm) improves 24 hour blood sugar levels and the breakdown of fats after meals in healthy adults.
Twelve participants (2 males and 10 females) are included in the study.
In this 3-day (until the morning of day 3) study, two different conditions are tested: eating a late dinner at 9:00pm (at 21:00) or an early dinner at 6:00pm (at 18:00).
During the experimental period, each participant wore a blood sugar device that continuously evaluated blood sugar levels.
Measurements for metabolism are performed on the morning of day 3.
The study is conducted over three days; day 1 is excluded from the analysis to adjust for the effects of the previous day's meal, and only data from the mornings of days 2 and 3 are used for the analysis.
Significant differences are observed in the average 24 hour blood sugar levels on day 2 between the two groups.
There was a big decrease in the respiratory quotient, a measure of how nutrients are used and a measure oxygen absorbed in the body, 30 min and 60 min after breakfast on day 3 in the early dinner group compared with the late dinner group.
Despite a difference of only 3 hours, eating dinner early at 6:00pm (at 18:00) has a positive effect on blood sugar levels and oxygen being added compared with eating dinner late 9:00pm (at 21:00).
