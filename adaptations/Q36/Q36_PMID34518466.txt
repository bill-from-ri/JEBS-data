I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. It’s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Introduction: Although spinal anesthesia (SA) may reduce postoperative morbidity, most urologists perform flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) under general anesthesia (GA).
The objective of our study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS performed under exclusive SA.
Methods: We analyzed all consecutive fURS performed under SA to treat renal stones from March 2011 to February 2017.
Details of technique, operative time, outcomes, need for further treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated.
Results: Two hundred thirty-four fURS under SA were considered.
SA was performed through L2-L3 vertebral interspace in 64.1%.
Patients were discharged the same day of surgery.
Mean stone burden was 13.5 ± 6.6 mm and mean operative time 76.9 ± 34.6 min.
Single-procedure SFR was 69.7%.
Further treatments were performed in 22.8%. 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications.
No Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIb complications were noticed.
99.6% of patients were satisfied with SA.
No cases of conversion from SA to GA occurred.
Conclusion: fURS can be performed safely and efficiently under SA, taking into account a few details of the technique.
Patients' satisfaction with SA is very high, and complications are rare.
Although SA is usually adopted in unfit patients for GA, it may be considered as a viable alternative in fit patients.
