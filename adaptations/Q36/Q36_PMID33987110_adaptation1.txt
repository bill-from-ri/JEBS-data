I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Managing stones in the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder)  has changed over the last few decades, and several treatment options exist. These options depend on the stone size, location, and other patient and stone factors.
While open surgery (cutting tissues so the surgeon has a full view of the organs) is now rarely performed, the use of medications to treat stones, which is called medical expulsive therapy (MET), has been controversial and perhaps only recommended for large stones in the ureter.
Common treatments are either shockwave lithotripsy, where shockwaves are focused to one point in the body and used to crush kidney stones into dust, or ureteroscopy, a procedure where a small telescope is inserted through the urethra and bladder and up the ureter to where the stone is located. Ureteroscopy is recommended for larger stones.
The overall practice of managing stones has remained mostly unchanged, but new methods and ways to deliver treatment have surfaced in modern times.
Advancements have occurred in all areas of stone disease to try and refine treatment and balance it with cost, patient choice and quality of life.
Sharing information on technology and showing their effectiveness and safety will eventually result in new recommendations among guidelines and new gold standards for care.
