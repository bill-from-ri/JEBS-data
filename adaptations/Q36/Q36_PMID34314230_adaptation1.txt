I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. It’s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a procedure that involves making an incision in the skin, inserting a tube to reach the stone, breaking it up into small pieces - sometimes using a laser, and removing it from the body. PCNL is the first choice treatment of kidney stones larger than 2 cm.
This study aims to evaluate if lasers perform as well as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones.
Researchers searched published studies to find the differences in the preparation before or during surgery, the number of complications after surgery, and the stone-free rate (patients that no longer have stone or stone fragments) in patients with kidney stones who had either laser or non-laser PCNL.
The number of complications are pooled together and analyzed.
How long the procedure takes and length of stay at the hospital or doctor office are also analyzed.

Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients underwent the procedure with a laser PCNL and 421 with a non-laser PCNL) are included in the analysis.
Surgical time and post-operation stay were shorter in the non-laser group.
The stone free rate is significantly higher in the non-laser group.
Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a slightly higher risk of a fever >100.4°F after the procedure.
The need for a blood transfusion (transfer) is not different between the laser and non-laser group.
There is a higher need in the laser group for a thin tube called a stent to be placed in the body to help drain urine, but it is not a major difference between the two groups on needing a stent.
In conclusion, non-laser percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) shows better surgical outcomes and a better stone free rate when compared to the laser PCNL.
