I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Treating kidney stones in urine tubes has changed over the last few decades. Many treatments exist depending on stone size, location, and other factors.
While large-cut surgery is rarely performed, drug treatment for removing stones is controversial and perhaps only recommended for large stones away from the kidney.
Main treatments include using shockwaves or a flexible telescope to help remove kidney stones, with the latter usually recommended for larger stones.
While the general idea of how to manage kidney stones has remain largely unchanged, the modern era has made new treatments to do so.
Advances have occured in all areas of treating the urinary system. These advances try to improve treatment while balancing cost, patient choice, and quality of life.
Spreading these technologies and demonstrating their success and safety will lead to new recommendations for international guidelines and new standard treatments.
