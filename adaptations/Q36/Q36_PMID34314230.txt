I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. It’s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Background Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the first choice treatment of renal stones larger than 2 cm.
We aimed to evaluate if lasers perform as equal as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones candidate to PCNL.
Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to assess the differences in the perioperative course, incidence of postoperative complications, and stone free-rate (SFR) in patients with kidney stones undergoing laser versus non-laser PCNL in randomized studies.
The incidences of complications were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios (RR), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and p-values.
Surgical time and length of stay were pooled using the inverse variance of the mean difference (MD) with a random effect, 95% CI, and p-values.
Analyses were two-tailed, with a significance set at p ≤0.05.
Results Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients undergoing holmium laser and 421 non-laser PCNL) were included in meta-analysis.
Surgical time and postoperative stay were shorter in the non-laser group (MD:11.14, 95% CI:2.32-19.96, p=0.002; MD:-0.81, 95%CI:-2.18-0.57 p=0.25, respectively).
SFR was significantly higher in the non-laser group (RR:1.08, 95% CI:1.01-1.15, p=0.03).
Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a non-significant higher risk of postoperative fever >38°C (RR:0.64, 95%CI: .31-1.30, p=0.22).
Transfusion rate did not differ between the two groups (RR:1.02, 95% CI:0.50-2.11 p=0.95).
The need for stent positioning due to urine extravasation was higher risk in the laser group but the difference did not reach significance (RR:0.49, 95% CI:0.17-1.41 p=0.19).
Conclusions Non-laser PCNL showed better perioperative outcomes and SFR as compared to holmium laser PCNL.
