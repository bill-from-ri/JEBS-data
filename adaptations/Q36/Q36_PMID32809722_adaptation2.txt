I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Kidney stones are a major burden on health care.
The proportion of cases of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with yearly healthcare costs of 3.8 billion US dollars.
More than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone issues.
The most common symptoms are blood in the urine and pain at or near the abdomen.
There are many treatment options for kidney stones.
They range from non-surgical away-from-hospital treatments to surgical procedures needing hospital care and increased risks of side effects.
Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), or kidney stone removal with shockwaves, is a truly non-srugical procedure compared to other surgical treatments like kidney surgery with a camera tube and making a small skin cut to remove stones.
The success of ESWL comes from pulverizing stones into small stones, which are removed naturally by the body.
Shockwaves are created and focused on a point in the body.
The shockwaves spread through the body with minimal loss of energy (and therefore damage) due to small density or hardness differences of the surrounding body parts.
At the boundary between the stone and body fluid, a large difference in hardness, along with many shockwaves in one area, creates a large burst of energy.
Via different mechanisms, this energy can break up the stone.
Repeating this process pulverzies the stone into small fragments that the body can remove painlessly and naturally.
