What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

Vitamin B6 is one of the most important molecules in the cells of living organisms.
Vitamin B6 dissolves in water. It is widely present in many foods, including meat, fish, nuts, beans, grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Vitamin B6 is present in many multivitamins for adults and children. It is added to foods, power bars, and powders.
There are several active chemicals (vitamers) which fall under the types of vitamin B6.
These vitamin B6 vitamers include pyridoxine alcohol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine.
Other vitamin B6 vitamers include  pyridoxal 5'phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'phosphate (PMP).
The main vitamers of vitamin B6 are different in meats and plants. The main vitamer in plants, pyridoxine, is less bioavailable (the amount of the substance taken up by the living organism).
Pyridoxine is the most common form of vitamin B6 found in multivitamins.
Vitamin B6 is involved in over 100 processes in the body including carbohydrate (sugar) metabolism, amino acid (protein) metabolism, , and lipid (fat) metabolism.
Vitamin B6 is also involved in the critical functioning of cells.
It plays a significant role in many important chemical reactions in the body.
Pyridoxine has a role in the development of the brain, immune function, and hemoglobin formation by helping produce important chemicals the body uses.
During pregnancy, fetal brain development requires adequate B6, and this continues throughout infancy.
The amount of vitamin B6 doctors recommend is made according to age and life stage. The highest recommended daily allowance is during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
