What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

Animal and human research studies suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency (not enough vitamin B6) affects the immune system.
White blood cell function and antibody production are damaged. Delayed allergy reactions are reduced (like the reaction to a tuberculosis (TB) skin test)).
Taking enough vitamin B6 to get  levels back to normal corrects the immune system problems. Taking very high doses supplements does not cause further improvement.
Human research also show that the amount of vitamin B6 in the body may affect tumor growth and disease.
Vitamin B6 deficiency (not enough vitamin B6 in the body) has been associated with immune system changes in the elderly.Vitamin B6 deficiency also affects people with HIV infections, kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Future research studies should focus on explaining exactly  how vitamin B6 affects the immune system and the right amount of vitamin B6 to take for the best immune system function.
