What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

Vitamin B6 is thought to be a most versatile chemical that participates in more than 100 biochemical reactions in the body.
It is involved in protein and amino acid (building blocks of protein) metabolism, carbohydrate (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism. It is also involved in neurotransmitter (chemicals involved in nerve impulses) production and DNA/RNA synthesis.
Vitamin B6 can also be a chemical that regulates gene expression.
Currently, signs and symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency is not a common disorder in the general population.
But Vitamin B6 deficiency may be present without signs or symptoms especially in the elderly.
This research give a complete overview of the actions  of vitamin B6 in the body.
Researchers show which specific problems can occur due to a lack of vitamin B6. Researchers also discuss possibilities for public health and adding supplements to foods.
 The database Medline (www.ncvi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched on the computer for terms like "vitamin B6", "pyridoxal", "cancer", "homocysteine", etc.
Researchers included studies with early findings from the forties as well as recent results from 2006 for a complete understanding.
This research was summarised and compared in different chapters.
Researchers have proposed that less than adequate (suboptimal) vitamin B6 levels are associated with certain diseases that particularly trouble the elderly population such as: decreased ability to think clearly, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and different types of cancer.
Some of these problems may be related to an increased homocysteine (amino acid) levels that is associated with vitamin B6 deficiency. There is also evidence for other ways suboptimal vitamin B6 levels could increase the risk for these chronic diseases.
