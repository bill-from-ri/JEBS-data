What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

A large number of studies have linked vitamin B6 to inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the general population.
It is not known if vitamin B6 is linked to future cardiovascular disease without inflammation.
Researchers measured the amount of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in the blood at the start of a prevention study in patients without cardiovascular disease.  Levels of PLP in blood can show how much vitamin B6 is present in the body. 
Low-level widespread inflammation in the body was measured by blood levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and GlyA. The blood level of PLP was about    37.2 nmol/L. These patients were followed up for about 8 years. During this time, 409 cardiovascular diseases events occurred, some were fatal.
In these patients, the amount of PLP in the blood was linked to the cardiovascular events that occurred. This link did not depend on other risk factors like age, sex, smoking, drinking alcohol, body weight (BMI), kidney function (eGFR), cholesterol levels, or blood pressure. 
But, the amount of hsCRP and GlyA in the blood was linked to an increase in the risk of having these cardiovascular events occurring.
Also, this link of the amount of PLP in the blood and the risk of getting cardiovascular disease was affected by gender.
In women, the link between the amount of PLP in the blood and getting cardiovascular disease did not depend on the other risk factors like age, smoking, drinking alcohol, or blood levels of hsCRP and GlyA. In men, the link was not as independent of these other risk factors.
In these patients, the level of PLP in blood was linked to getting cardiovascular disease. This link was affected by the usual risk factors and measures of inflammation.
The association of low blood levels of PLP with high risk of harmful cardiovascular outcomes wasaffected by gender. This association was stronger and independent in women.
