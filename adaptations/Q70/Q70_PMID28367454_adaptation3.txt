What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

The immune system is critical in preventing infection and cancer, and malnutrition can weaken different aspects of the immune system to decrease immunity.
Previous research suggested that vitamin B6 deficiency could decrease blood antibody production resulting in an increase in IL4 (cytokine-chemical marker of inflammation) production.
Facts about whether vitamin B6 deficiency would impair immune cell function, cytokines secretion, and production of chemicals involved in (JAK/STAT signaling) a pathway that helps control the immune response are largely unknown.
Researchers study the effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on the immune system by studying T lymphocyte (type of white blood cell) function, the secretion of immune chemicals, and the function of certain genes.
We made a vitamin B6-deficient mouse model by supplying a diet without enough vitamin B6.
The results showed that vitamin B6 deficiency slows down growth and inhibits lymphocyte cell production and functions.
When T lymphocytes were activated,  vitamin B6 deficiency influenced the secretion of some immune chemicals.
This study showed that vitamin B6 deficiency affected the function of certain genes.
The right amount of supplement of vitamin B6 could benefit immunity of the organism.
