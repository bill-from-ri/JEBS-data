What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

There is little evidence regarding the association between serum vitamin B6 concentration and subsequent mortality.
We aimed to evaluate the association of serum vitamin B6 concentration with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in the general population using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Our study examined 12,190 adults participating in NHANES from 2005 to 2010 in the United States.
The mortality status was linked to National Death Index (NDI) records up to 31 December 2015.
Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biologically active form of vitamin B6.
Vitamin B6 status was defined as deficient (PLP < 20 nmol/L), insufficient (PLP â‰¥ 20.0 and <30.0 nmol/L), and sufficient (PLP â‰¥ 30.0 nmol/L).
We established Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate the associations of categorized vitamin B6 concentration and log-transformed PLP concentration with all-cause and cause-specific mortality by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).
In our study, serum vitamin B6 was sufficient in 70.6% of participants, while 12.8% of the subjects were deficient in vitamin B6.
During follow-up, a total of 1244 deaths were recorded, including 294 cancer deaths and 235 CVD deaths.
After multivariate adjustment in Cox regression, participants with higher serum vitamin B6 had a 15% (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77, 0.93) reduced risk of all-cause mortality and a 19% (HR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.68, 0.98) reduced risk for CVD mortality for each unit increment in natural log-transformed PLP.
A higher log-transformed PLP was not significantly associated with a lower risk for cancer mortality.
Compared with sufficient vitamin B6, deficient (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.60) and insufficient (HR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.02, 1.38) vitamin B6 level were significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality.
There was no significant association for cause-specific mortality.
Participants with higher levels of vitamin B6 had a lower risk for all-cause mortality.
These findings suggest that maintaining a sufficient level of serum vitamin B6 may lower the all-cause mortality risk in the general population.
