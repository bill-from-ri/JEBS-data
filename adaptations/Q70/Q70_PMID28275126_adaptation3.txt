What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

Higher blood levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) have been linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The level of PLP in the blood is a sign of the level of vitamin B6 in the blood.
This could be explained by Inflammation, including types of vitamin B6 metabolism.
Researchers measured chemicals that are signs (biomarkers) of the amount of vitamin B6 in blood. They  studied these 3 biomarkers In relation to the risk of CRC.
This large study was done in Sweden and compared 613 participants with CRC to people without CRC.
The participants were followed  from 1985 to 2009. From the start of the study to the time of the CRC diagnosis was about 8 years. The  biomarkers measured in the blood were PLP, pyridoxal, pyridoxic acid (PA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK), and xanthurenic acids (XAs)
Researchers calculated the risks of CRC and biomarkers for vitamin B6 status, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when the level of free radicals is too high compared to the level of antioxidants in the body. These biomarkers included PLP, HK:XA, and PAr (PA: (PLP + pyridoxal)).
Higher blood PLP levels were linked to lower CRC risk for many participants. PLP sufficiency (enough) compared to deficiency (not enough) was also linked to lower CRC risk.
The calculated biomarkers, HK: XA and PAr were both associated with an increased risk for getting CRC.
For HK:XA and PAr, this risk was mainly seen in participants with less than 10.5 years of follow-up between blood samples taken at the start of the study and the CRC diagnosis.
Vitamin B6 deficiency (blood PLP) is associated with a clear increase in CRC risk.
The other biomarkers studied (showing vitamin B6 status and vitamin B6-associated oxidative stress and inflammation), may play a role in cancer development rather than starting it.
