What happens wen you don't get enough vitamin b6?

Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6 in the body. PLP is involved in more than 4% of the chemical reactions of proteins in the cell.
Changes in vitamin B6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases.
For example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, a protein that appeared early in evolution, result in seizures. These seizures are due to an increase in a chemical (made during vitamin B6 metabolism) that stops the function of PLP.
PLP is also required for the metabolism of homocysteine (an amino acid involved in vitamin B metabolism)..
Lower blood levels of B6 vitamers (active vitamin B6 chemicals-PLP and pyridoxine) are associated with  hyperhomocysteinemia (excess blood homocysteine). Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a higher risk of many cardiovascular diseases.
During the past 30 years, a lot of research has tried to explain links between vitamin B6 and cancer.
High blood levels of vitamin B6, or the related lower blood levels of homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients with blood and solid organ neoplasms.
Recently, vitamin B6 metabolism has been shown to control tumor cells' ability to adjust to many different types of stress.
Also, increased levels of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK-a protein involved in producing PLP), have been shown to predict good  outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).
This research discusses the importance of vitamin B6 metabolism in the disease outcome of cancer patients.
