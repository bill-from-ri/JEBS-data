When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

This study aims to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies, medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. The study also aims to determine if certain monoclonal antibodies can lead to spread of virus variants through mutations that may reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies.
Researchers evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies on the viral load (quantity of the virus) found in the nose and the number of mutations in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies.
The monoclonal antibodies used are bamlanivimab alone (in 4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (in 23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (in5 patients).
The viral load in the nose of monoclonal antibodies-treated patients decreased 7 days after the medicines were given.
Five patients with a weak immune system who were given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab are found to have reduced mutations that allow the virus to enter cells and cause infection.
Two patients with coronavirus variants have a mutation that enabled the virus to enter cells 7 days after the medicines are given. The same occurred with a third patient 14 days after the medicines are given.
The fourth patient with a variant has a mutation 7 days after the medicine is stopped, and the fifth patient has a variant with a mutation on day 21.
The start of the mutation is connected with a stable or increased viral load in the nose in 3 out of 5 patients.
In conclusion, two monoclonal antibody drugs can drive the targeting of coronavirus variants in patients with weak immune systems.
Patients given monoclonal antibody should be closely monitored, and measures to limit virus spread should be strengthened.
