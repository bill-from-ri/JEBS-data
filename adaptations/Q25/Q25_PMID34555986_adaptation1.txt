When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

Treatments for people with COVID-19, a viral breathing-related disorder, are needed.
One option is to use monoclonal antibodies, which are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce.
Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are two types of monoclonal antibodies.
This evaluation is of the 3rd phase of a clinical study called BLAZE that examines bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adults.
The main result researchers look for is COVID-19 related hospital stays that lasted at least 24 hours or death. This result occurred in 2.1% of patients in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group.
Based on opinions of experts, the FDA's efforts to shorten the approval process for medicines and for medical journals to make information available is admirable.
However, these shortened processes make the details of the BLAZE study and producing accurate reviews difficult.
It seems that if there are any benefits for bamlanivimab alone in COVID-19, they are not clear-cut.
Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants of COVID-19 and is not effective against the delta variant.
Therefore, the benefits of the bamlanivimab/etesevimab in phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 trial may be solely due to the etesevimab medicine, and this needs to be tested.
