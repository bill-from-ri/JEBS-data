When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

We aimed to test the effect of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibodies that bind to only one site of a foreign organism. We determine if mAbs may help grow mutated virus variants that may weaken mAb effectiveness.
We test the effect of mAbs on the virus species and amount in the upper throat of mAb-treated patients.
The mAbs used were: Bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (5 patients).
The amount of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which cause a respiratory illness, in the upper throats of mAb-treated patients decreased 7 days after treatment.
Five patients with an impaired immune system and given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab had mutations that reduced the effect of mAbs.
Two patients with SARS-CoV-2 variants had a mutations 7 days after treatment, along with a third patient 14 days after treatment.
The fourth patient had a variant with a mutation 7 days after treatment, along with a fifth patient on day 21.
The onset of the mutation came with a rebound or stabilization of virus amount in 3/5 patients.
Two-mAb treatment can lead to resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in patients with an impaired immune system.
Patients given mAbs should be monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced.
