When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

Our objective is to measure the effectiveness and safety of antiviral antibody treatments and substances from blood for treating the new coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a viral respiratory disease.


People with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 were randomized to antiviral antibody therapies, substances from blood, or standard care or an inactive placebo.





As of 21 July 2021, we identified 47 trials evaluating a variety of substances from blood and antiviral antibody treatments for treating covid-19.
Patients with non-severe disease given antiviral antibodies had lower risk of hospitalsation than those given the inactive placebo treatment.
They did not have an important impact on any other outcome.
There was no notable difference between antibodies.
No other treatment had a meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe covid-19.
No treatment, including antiviral antibodies, had an important effect on any outcome in patients with severe covid-19, except the antibodies casirivimab-imdevimab. These antibodies may reduce risk of death in those who do not make the antibodies naturally.
In patients with non-severe covid-19, casirivimab-imdevimab likely reduces hospitalisation. Bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalisation.
Substances from blood and other antibody treatments may not give any meaningful aid.
