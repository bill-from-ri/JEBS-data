When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

Alarming variants of SARS-CoV-2 (a viral respiratory disease) show reduced elimination by vaccine-induced and highly-specific antibodies. Thus, different treatments are needed.
We tested horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), a mixture of antibodies that bind to the same foreign organism. These pAbs are being measured in Costa Rica against five alarming, global variants: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta.
Horse-derived pAbs efficiently treat the concerning variants with much lower dosages than those used in clinical trials.
Horse-derived pAbs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost treatment for COVID-19 (a widespread viral respiratory disease).
