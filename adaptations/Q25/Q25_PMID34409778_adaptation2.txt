When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

Hyperinflammation and overproduction of inflammatory molecules is a poor predictor of recovery in patients with severe pneumonia (an infection that inflames air sacs in lungs) related to the viral respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
In COVID-19, disease-causing white blood cell overactivation is a key mediator of damage to tissues, increased blood clots, and inflammatory molecule overproduction.
These inflammatory molecules invade many body parts like the lungs, heart, and nervous system.
This overproduction of inflammatory molecules can cause multi-organ damage and life-threatening issues.
Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to only one site of a foreign organism. It may aid some cases of COVID-19.
During inflammation, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release, release of molecules that activate specific white blood cells, is crucial for an immune response.
The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when a foreign organism attaches to a cell and activates a signal.
Mavrilimumab combats the effect of GM-CSF and reduces hyperinflammation linked to pneumonia in COVID-19. This effect stregthens the idea that mavrilimumab, when added to standard treatment, may improve health outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those with pneumonia.
With this paper, we aim to show how mavrilimumab reduces overproduction of inflammatory molecules in patients with COVID-19.
