Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

During infections, the host redistributes iron in order to starve pathogens from this nutrient.
Several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage.
Ferritin is the most important iron storage protein.
It is composed of variable proportions of two peptides, the L- and H-ferritins (FTL and FTH).
We previously showed that macrophages increase their expression of FTH1 when they are infected in vitro with Mycobacterium avium, without a significant increase in FTL.
In this work, we investigated the role of macrophage FTH1 in M. avium infection in vivo.
We found that mice deficient in FTH1 in myeloid cells are more resistant to M. avium infection, presenting lower bacterial loads and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type littermates, due to the lower levels of available iron in the tissues.
Importantly, we also found that FTH1 produced by myeloid cells in response to infection may be found in circulation and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution.
Specifically, in the absence of FTH1 in myeloid cells, increased expression of ferroportin is observed in liver granulomas and increased iron accumulation occurs in hepatocytes.
These results highlight the importance of FTH1 expression in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection.
