Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

Ferritin, which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism.
Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL-1 in men and between 30-300 ngmL-1 in women.
Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immunomodulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers.
When ferritin level exceeds 1000 ÂµgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia.
Iron chelators such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload.
The inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of COVID-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels.
Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron chelator administered orally at 20-40 mgkg-1 once daily, as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 hours.
It can be combined with monoclonal antibodies, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for COVID-19 victims.
In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for COVID-19.
