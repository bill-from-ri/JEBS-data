Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

Iron is a necessary nutrient for many metabolic processes in almost all living organisms.
During infections, a battle for iron takes place between the human and disease-causing organisms (pathogens).
The liver protein hepcidin, which is linked to defensins (bacteria-fighting proteins of the immune system), plays an important role by taking iron from pathogens by moving iron into human cells, mainly immune cells.
While this event is well known in certain bacterial infections, much less is known about viral infections.
Iron metabolism may also affect the function of cells of the immune system.
Once stimulated by touching cells with parts of foreign organisms attached to them, immune cells need iron to sustain the energy needed for an effective cellular and immune response.
The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by a virus causing a lung infection) has boosted clinical and medical research over the possible influences of nutrients on SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of either contracting or aiding the infection.
Here we review the links between iron metabolism and COVID-19, belonging to the wider field of study of the so-called "nutritional immunity".
A better understanding of these links may help develop more effective strategies for managing COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.
