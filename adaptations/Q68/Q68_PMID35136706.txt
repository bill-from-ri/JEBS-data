Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

The importance of ferritin as an inflammatory marker is well recognized.
However, it is unknown whether this differs between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients.
The blood levels of ferritin, white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase may all be measured to check whether there is a difference.
The researchers want to see if the inflammatory process changes between these two kinds (LDH).
Methodology: Blood samples were collected from 119 COVID-19 patients in the hospital and 50 healthy persons.
Corona virus was discovered when a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested using the RT-PCR technique.
Ferritin, LDH, WBC, and CRP were also tested using Min Vidus, AccEnT 200, Ruby system, and Latx in that sequence.
The study revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher levels of ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH in their blood than healthy people, with values of 539,08 ng/mL, 44.7109/L, 22.95 mg/L, and 403.95 U/L for COVID-19 patients versus 77.103 ng/mL, 4.9.4109/L, 6.53 mg/L, and 171.56 U/L for healthy people.
According to the existing data, males are more likely to be infected with COVID-19 (81%) than females (32%), and females had greater ferritin, CRP, WBC, and LDH levels than males.
Because they are related to an optimum test for predicting COVID-19 infection, the recommended cut-off values for ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH are 109.8 ng/mL, 14.9109/L, 10.15 mg/L, and 229.33 U/L, respectively.
Finally, an increase in ferritin levels in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 is linked to an increase in inflammatory markers including CRP, WBC, and LDH, which may assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
