Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

Ferritin (an iron-containing protein), which has 24 light and heavy parts in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism.
Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL-1 in men and between 30-300 ngmL-1 in women.
Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immune-system-regulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers.
When ferritin level exceeds 1000 ÂµgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia (high ferritin levels).
Iron binders such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload (or high levels of iron).
The inflammation process and poor recovery of COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) may be linked to high ferritin levels.
Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron binder given by mouth at 20-40 mgkg-1 once daily, as well as deferoxamine initially given at 1000 mg in the vein followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 hours.
It can be combined with antibodies (immune system products to fight infections), antioxidants, corticosteroids (specific steroids), and lactoferrin (a protein in mammalian milk) to make iron binding treatment effective for COVID-19 victims.
In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antiscarring activity of iron binders, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a possibly new treatment for COVID-19.
