Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

SARS-CoV-2 infection (a viral lung infection) can cause effects ranging from patients with no symptoms to life-threatening conditions.
Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe lung effect and develop altered levels of immune cells and strikingly increased levels of IL-6 (an immune signaling molecule called a cytokine).
There is an increased cytokine release with hyperferritinemia (high levels of ferritin - an iron-containing protein). This leads to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome disease group.
Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases).
Many studies have shown the immune-system-regulating effects of ferritin and its links with death risks and high inflammation.
High levels of free iron are harmful in the body, especially through damage that can lead to scarring.
Iron binding represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload.
Also, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-scarring activity.
Herein, we analyse the disease-causing role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion treatment as a new treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic.
