Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

While it took decades to learn that ferritin (an iron-containing protein) is more than a marker of iron storage level, it took some time during the COVID-19 pandemic (a pandemic caused by a virus that causes lung infections) to wonder why there are high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19.
Unsurprisingly, inflammation markers were not a satisfactory explanation.
Also, how ferritin acts in patients with severe COVID-19 and the resulting high death rates in patients with high ferritin levels forced further studies to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases.
Ferritin was at first described to accompany many immediate infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an immediate response to inflammation.
However, with hyperferritinemic syndrome (high ferritin levels) linking four severe disease conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases) added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a disease-causing role rather than an extremely increased protein only.
In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the range of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the disease-causing role of ferritin.
Without doubt, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better treatment and side effect management with severe diseases.
We present the origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various disease-causing and clinical processes in our article.
Also, the possibilities of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed.
