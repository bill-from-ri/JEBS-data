Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

Large changes in COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) disease progression urges the need to find the most relevant markers to predict patients' outcomes.
We tested iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients of the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with different clinical needs, from September to November 2020.
One hundred and twenty-seven had SARS-CoV-2 and 176 did not.
Iron-related lab measures and immune signaling molecules were measured in blood samples collected soon after admission.
Basic background data, other diseases, and clinical results were recorded.
Patients were assigned into five groups according to severity.
Blood iron and transferrin (an iron-containing protein) levels at admission were lower in patients with COVID-19 than those without.
The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (certain immune signaling molecules) were increased in patients with COVID-19.
The lowest blood iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were linked with the worst outcomes.
Iron levels were lower with higher IL-6. Higher levels of this immune signaling molecule were linked with a worse recovery.
Blood ferritin (iron-containing protein) levels at diagnosis were higher in patients with COVID-19 than those without.
Blood iron is the simplest lab test to be used as a predictor of disease progression in COVID-19 patients.
