Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

As background for this article, several studies have suggested that COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) is a full-body disease that can affect several organs, including the brain.
In the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause imbalances of some nutrients that promote complex biochemical reactions in certain brain functions.
The study's objective is to understand the disease-causing ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) in the brain and the link between certain nutrients and brain disorders after infection. The objective is also to provide new insights on the drug creation for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Databases were used to search studies published up September 2021, focusing on the role of specific elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain.
The imbalance of important elements can increase SARS-CoV-2 effects in the brain and increase the damage to the brain since many brain processes can be linked with the balance of metal and metal-carrying proteins.
Some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the link between brain cells as a vulnerable region of the brain to brain disorders after viral infection.
Considering all the evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the link between brain disorders and imbalance of specific elements in the brain after viral infection.
In conclusion, certain elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies that fight infections, and block virus growth.
However, the link between specific elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements is largely unknown.
Thus, there is much to be explored to understand the biochemical processes involved between specific elements and viral infections, especially in the brain.
