What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

This research studies factors that may predict painful blood vessel blockages (VOC-vaso-occlusive crises) in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients in Cameroon.
Researchers found out facts about the population, signs and symptoms, and their blood.
Genetic testing was done for 40 mutations in 17 pain-relating genes, three fetal hemoglobin areas on genes, two genes related to kidney disease, and the HBA1/HBA2 (alpha-globin)genes.
Models were performed to predict outcomes.
A total of 436 patients that had not taken hydroxycarbamide or opioids were studied. Half the patients were younger than 16 years old and half were older.
Female sex, body mass index, Hb/HbF (hemoglobin/fetal hemoglobin), blood transfusions, higher white blood cell count, and consultations or hospitalisations are significantly linked with blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises (VOC)).
Three pain-related gene variants (mutations) are linked to VOC.
Five pain-related gene variants are linked to the amount of hospitalisations/consultations.
These gene variants are specific mutations in COMT, FAAH, OPRM1, ADRB2, and UGT2B7 genes.
A specific mutation in the HBA1/HBA2 genes are linked to increased VOC.
Specific gene variants on the BCL11A gene and the HBS1L-MYB gene increase HbF and are linked to decreased hospitalisation.
The APOL1 G1/G2 genes (related to kidney disease) are linked to increased hospitalisation.
This first study from an African country has provided evidence supporting the  possible development of a genetic risk model for pain in Sickle Cell Disease.
