What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Background: Our objective was to investigate the combined and differential effects of alpha-thalassemia -3.7 kb deletion and HbF-promoting quantitative trait loci (HbF-QTL) in Senegalese hydroxyurea (HU)-free children and young adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA).
Procedure: Steady-state biological parameters and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with SCA.
The age of the first hospitalized VOC was also recorded.
These data were correlated with the alpha-globin and HbF-QTL genotypes.
For the latter, three different genetic loci were studied (XmnI, rs7482144; BCL11A, rs1427407; and the HBS1L-MYB region, rs28384513) and a composite score was calculated, ranging from zero (none of these three polymorphisms) to six (all three polymorphisms at the homozygous state).
Results: A positive clinical impact of the HbF-QTL score on VOC rate, HbF, leucocytes, and C-reactive protein levels was observed only for patients without alpha-thalassemia deletion.
Conversely, combination of homozygous -3.7 kb deletion with three to six HbF-QTL was associated with a higher VOC rate.
The age of the first hospitalized VOC was delayed for patients with one or two alpha-thalassemia deletions and at least two HbF-QTL.
Conclusion: Alpha-thalassemia -3.7 kb deletion and HbF-QTL are modulating factors of SCA clinical severity that interact with each other.
They should be studied and interpreted together and not separately, at least in HU-free children.
