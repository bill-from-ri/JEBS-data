What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disease that causes abnormal red blood cell flow through blood vessels.
Due to their effects on sickle hemoglobin (HbS) chemistry and red blood cell shape changes, alpha-thalassemia (another genetic blood disease)and HbF (fetal hemoglobin) levels are known to change the course of SCA. 
The aim of our study was to find out if the number of HbF-QTL, quantitative trait loci (QTL-special sections of DNA) would influence the severity of SCA as seen in alpha-thalassemia.
Results showed that alpha-thalassemia protected SCA patients from cerebral vasculopathy (diseases of blood vessels in the brain). But, it increased the risk for more painful crises due to blood vessel blockages.
We also showed that more HbF-QTL may protect more against cerebral vasculopathy, but only for children with certain genetic types of alpha-thalassemia.
