What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Researchers analyzed the effects of an alpha-thalassemia (another genetic blood disease) mutation and fetal hemoglobin-promoting quantitative trait loci (HbF-QTL (special section of DNA)) in Senegalese children and young adults with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) who have not received the medicine, hydroxyurea. 
Steady biological signs and crises from blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises-VOC) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA).
The age of the first hospitalized VOC was also recorded.
These facts were compared to patients who had alpha-globin and HbF-QTL genes.
Three different gene regions on the HbF-QTL gene were studied in detail. A score was given to patients from zero to six depending on the different changes (mutations) at the 3 gene regions.
A higher HbF-QTL score resulted in better signs of SCA disease outcome only for patients without the alpha-thalassemia mutation.
With the alpha-thalassemia mutation, a higher HbF-QTL score was linked to more VOC (vaso-occlusive crises).
The age of the first hospitalization for VOC was older in patients with the alpha-thalassemia mutation and at least 2 HbF-QTL gene region mutations.
The alpha-thalassemia mutation and the HbF-QTL gene mutations react with each other and can change the severity of Sickle Cell Anemia.
These genes and their mutations should be studied together, not separately, at least in children who have not received hydroxyurea.
