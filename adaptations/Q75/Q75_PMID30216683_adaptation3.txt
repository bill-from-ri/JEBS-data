What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an important protein that affects the severity of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).
HbF is changed mainly by three important quantitative trail loci (QTL-special sections of DNA) on chromosomes 2, 6, and 11.
Five single mutations in the three QTLs were studied. The roles of these mutations in HbF were studied. The research evaluated how these mutations affected the variety of characteristics seen in Iraqui Kurds with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).  
Three minor single mutations of the HBG2 gene resulted in the most important changes in HbF.
The other two single mutations did not contribute significantly.
An increase in the number of these minor single mutations resulted in an increase in the amount of HbF and hemoglobin. This also resulted in a decrease in blood lactic dehydrogenase (an enzyme from tissue damage), white blood cells, transfusions, and occurences of pain.
Research showed these mutations in all three major HbF QTLs are important to HbF. These mutations also contribute to the variety of disease outcomes in Iraqui Kurds with SCD. The added amount of these minor single mutations may better predict variety of disease outcome in this population.
