Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Different types of diets aimed at preventing Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) and a dangerous lung infection called pneumonia are continually being considered.
Unfortunately, studies in humans have not confirmed any specific foods to be effective in the case of Covid-19.
The body's immune system is the key to reducing the seriousness of Covid-19, and perhaps by modifying the immune system in the right way, we can save human lives with prevention efforts.
Many clinical studies show that certain parts of food can help stimulate the immune response in patients with various diseases, such as cancer or AIDS, and in healthy people who are at risk of a viral infection.
Natural substances found in nature are often seen as important parts in the fight against viruses.
Many products consumed by people and used in traditional medicine are shown to contain substances with properties described as anti-inflammatories that can relieve pain or swelling, antibacterial to prevent the spread of bacteria, and antiviral to fight viruses. Examples include vitamin C from fruits and substances in honey, garlic, onions, ginger, turmeric, and black pepper.
However, there is no strong scientific evidence or analyses with a lot data suggesting that herbs, spices, health-promoting food ingredients, or dietary supplements prevent infection of coronavirus. Additionally, there is little data that they minimize Covid-19 symptoms or can even be used to treat infections, including severe COVID pneumonia, sudden lung failure, a cytokine storm (when the body's immune system floods the blood stream with proteins called cytokines), clotting or scabbing disorders, or multiple organ failure.
