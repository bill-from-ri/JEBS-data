Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Diet strategies for preventing COVID-19 (a breathing-related viral disorder) and pneumonia (an infection the inflames the lung air sacs) are being considered.
Unfortunately, as with drugs, human studies have not confirmed specific foods to be effective with COVID-19.
We know the immune system is key to reducing the severity of COVID-19. Perhaps by influencing it the right way, we can save humans with preventative steps.
Many studies show that certain foods used as medicine can beneficially activate the immune response in patients with many diseases, like cancer or AIDS (a disease from an immunodeficiency virus), and healthy people at risk of viral infections.
Natural substances are usually seen as valuable tools in the fight against viruses due to the structural diversity and safety of the substances.
Many products consumed by people and used in traditional medicine have substances with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties like vitamins and other plant chemicals.
However, there is no evidence that herbs, spices, health-promoting food ingredients, or dietary supplements can prevent, reduce, or treat COVID-19 or other infections, including severe COVID-19 pneymonia, immediate lung failure, inflammatory molecule overproduction, blood clotting disorders, or multiple organ failure.
