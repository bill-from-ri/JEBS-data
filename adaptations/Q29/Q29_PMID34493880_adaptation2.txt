Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

The World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2, as a global pandemic in early 2020 after the respiratory viral disease spread to over 180 countries, leading to tens of thousands of cases and many deaths in a few months.
Thus, this paper aims to summarize the evidence for links between nutrition and boosting the immune system in the fight against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
This review measures the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements on the body's defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2.
There is a strong link between consuming biological ingredients like vitamins C-E and minerals like zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection.
These biological ingredients can come from nutrient-rich foods or vitamin supplements.
Also, these biological molecules may help boost the immune response, healing response, and recovery time.
Thus, eating healthy foods rich in vitamins C-E with zinc and other helpful molecules could boost the immune system and protect the body from serious infections.
