Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

This review focuses on the use of plant based foods for increasing the immunity of all age groups against Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related illness).
In humans, coronaviruses, which cause COVID-19, are included in the type of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which can cause fever, cough, and breathing problems.
New infectious diseases, such as SARS, present a major threat to public health.
The new coronavirus has quickly spread to many countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
People with a low or weakened immune response are probably most effected by Covid-19.
Plant based foods increase the good bacteria in the stomach which are helpful and make up of 85% of the immune system.
Drinking plenty of water, consuming minerals like magnesium and Zinc, vitamins, herbs, food with a lot of vitamins C, D & E, and a healthy life style can promote health and can fight this infection.
Different research studies find that a powerful antioxidant (a vitamin or mineral that can repair cells) called Glutathione and a plant-based vitamin called Quercetin may prevent infections, including Covid-19.
In conclusion, plant based foods play a key role in strengthening the immunity of people to control Covid-19.
