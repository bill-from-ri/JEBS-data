Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Lactobacilli is a type of probiotic (good bacteria) found in the digestive system and can be consumed to improve gut health. When lactobacilli is given through a spray in the nose in mice, it can help regulate the natural immune or infection-fighting response in the lungs and fight lung infections.
Lactobacilli bacteria that comes from plants is tested to see how it impacts the immune systems of the cells in the lungs and if it can reduce the ability of the coronavirus (a virus causing COVID-19 - a lung infection) from entering the cells.
Two types of lactobacilli bacteria that come from plants, called MPL16 and CRL506, are tested to understand their influence on the production of cells that are part of the immune response and the development of proteins.
Additionally, these two types of bacteria increase the resistance of certain cells in the lungs called Calu-3 against the coronavirus.
The lactobacilli MPL16 bacteria started these beneficial effects more efficiently than the CRL1506.
No lactobacilli bacteria from the tested plants can change the resistance of Calu-3 cells to coronavirus infection.
As of now, the possible benefits of good bacteria (probiotics) on the immune system against the coronavirus and Covid-19 have been pulled from studies of other viruses.
It is believed that this study is the first to show the ability of lactobacilli to positively influence the replication of the new coronavirus.
Further studies and experiments with animals with the coronavirus are necessary to identify specific types of lactobacilli from plants for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19.
