Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Viral infections are a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. The importance of public health practices like handwashing and vaccinations in reducing their spread is well supported.
Also, proper nutrition can help support ideal immune function, reducing the effect of infections.
Many vitamins and trace elements or minerals help support immune cells, thus increasing resistance to infections.
Other nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids, help maintain ideal immune system function.
This manuscript discusses the possible role of micronutrients supplementation to support immunity, especially against breathing-related virus infections.
Some trials highlight the important role of vitamins A, C, and D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in influencing the immune response.
Taking vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and zinc may be a safe and low-cost way to support idea immune system function. It may also reduce the risk and effects of infection, including viral respiratory infections.
Supplementation should be an addition to a healthy diet and used within recommended safety limits.
Thus, having ideal nutrition, with micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids supplementation, may be a cost-effective, underrated strategy to help reduce the effects of infectious diseases worldwide, including the viral respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
