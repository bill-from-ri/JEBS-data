Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Public health practices, including handwashing and vaccinations, help reduce the spread and impact of infections.
However, the global impact of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary.
Sudden infections in the lung, also called acute respiratory tract or breathing-related infections, for example, were responsible for about 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016.
The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune or infection-fighting system is well-documented.
A lot of data from existing studies show that vitamins and natural acids play important roles in supporting the immune system. These include vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids and other acids.
Not eating or maintaining enough of these nutrients is common, leading to a decrease in the body's ability to resist infections which may result in higher illness, loss, and death because of disease.
Based on this available information, the following conclusions are made: 1) using supplements to add vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and inexpensive way to help support immune system functions; 2) supplements above the recommended amount, but still within safety limits, for certain nutrients may be allowed; and 3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutrition plans in their recommendations to improve public health.
