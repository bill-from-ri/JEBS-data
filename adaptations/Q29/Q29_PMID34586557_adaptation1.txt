The Covid-19 virus has caused a pandemic in humans and targets the organs and tissues that help people breathe. It also causes viral pneumonia which is an infection in the lungs.
This unusual viral pneumonia is quickly spreading to all parts of the world and is currently impacting about 105 million people with 2.3 million deaths.
Reviews describe the history of the Covid-19 virus, its genetic make-up, how it replicates, and how it develops with attention to Nigella sativum (N. sativum), a black seed from a plant that may be a possible treatment.
N. sativum seeds have been used for centuries, both for prevention and treatment of different diseases.
This review summarizes the potential role of N. sativum seeds against Covid-19 infection using computers and lab and animal experiments.
