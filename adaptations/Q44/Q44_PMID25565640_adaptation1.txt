What percent of blood loss shows the sign symptom of hypovolemic shocks begin?

Current monitoring technologies are unable to detect early changes associated with significant blood loss.
A novel model to calculate the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) was previously introduced by the authors in a secondary study. CRI measures physiological reserve, or how an organ responds to stress, which can be used as an indicator of how a patient will respond to intensive care.
In the present study, the authors hypothesized that the CRI would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared to traditional methods.
Vital signs were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage (excessive blood loss) of âˆ¼1.2 L of blood.
CRI decreased across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs.
Statistical analysis of CRI showed high confidence in the ability of the test to produce accurate results.
In contrast, blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower confidence  for detection and specificity rates.
CRI detected blood loss and restoration with greater specificity than did other traditional measures.
Single measurement of CRI may enable more accurate assessment of health emergencies. CRI monitoring may allow for earlier detection of declining health.
