I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Treatment success for patients with full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, is limited by muti-factor disease causes, multi-organ damage, full-body effect, and complex causes for immune cell dysfunction.
Treatment targeting creation and survival of antibody-creating immune cells are not effective for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory groups.
One target group is the type I interferon pathway, a cellular signaling pathway that affects the entire immune system.
Type I interferons increase the amount of certain signaling proteins and influence important antiviral responses.
Impaired type I interferon signaling is detectable in many with SLE and similar diseases. The extent of this impairment is linked with disease severity, making type I interferons a possible treatment target.
The recent approval of the type I interferon blocking molcule or antibody, anifrolumab, by a government agency for treating SLE demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway.
Still, the interferon pathway affects multiple targets and signaling pathways that are incompletely understood.
Understanding the complex type I interferon pathway and its influence on lupus disease will be valuable for further development of targeted SLE treatments.
This review summarizes the immune middlemen of the interferon pathway, its link with disease creation, and treatments targeting the pathway when it is impaired.
