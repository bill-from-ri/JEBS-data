I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Therapeutic success in treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is limited by the multivariate disease etiology, multi-organ presentation, systemic involvement, and complex immunopathogenesis.
Agents targeting B-cell differentiation and survival are not efficacious for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory mediators.
One such target is the type I interferon pathway.
Type I interferons upregulate interferon gene signatures and mediate critical antiviral responses.
Dysregulated type I interferon signaling is detectable in many patients with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, and the extent of this dysregulation is associated with disease severity, making type I interferons therapeutically tangible targets.
The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with SLE demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway.
Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has pleiotropic biology, with multiple cellular targets and signaling components that are incompletely understood.
Deconvoluting the complexity of the type I interferon pathway and its intersection with lupus disease pathology will be valuable for further development of targeted SLE therapeutics.
This review summarizes the immune mediators of the interferon pathway, its association with disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic modalities targeting the dysregulated interferon pathway.
