I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Metformin is a medication that has been proposed as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells).
Metformin targets certain cells in the immune system that play a critical role in development of autoimmune diseases, which are diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues.
This review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of redox homeostasis, a balanced level of reactive oxygen molecules that signal to other cells.
Clinical trials in lupus patients with mild to moderate disease activity and studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin.
The mechanism that creates this therapeutic effect is largely unknown.
Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in specific situations.
Multiple cell types contribute to lupus.
The major knowledge gaps are whether the effectiveness of metformin is linked to a restored redox homeostasis in the immune system, and if it is linked, in which type of cells does it occur.
Researchers also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and whether it relates to a specific mechanism or process in the body.
Finally, the identification of specific biological factors to predict treatment outcomes would be of great value.
