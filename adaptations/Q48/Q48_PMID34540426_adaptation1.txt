I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Lupus nephritis is the most common form systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) that severely impacts organs.
About 30% of patients do not respond to standard treatment.
This report summarizes a case of treating lupus nephritis by targeting a type of protein called interleukin-17, demonstrating its possible benefit.
The case is of a childbearing age woman with lupus who developed lupus nephritis and did not respond to available treatment.
During follow up visits with the patient, infection with a common sexually transmitted disease called human papillomavirus (HPV) is detected. A possible trigger and the following care and treatment is based on this discovery.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17 - a chemical messenger) seems to be a basic key in lupus and lupus nephritis.
Therefore, it is decided to start treatment with an anti-IL-17A antibody drug called secukinumab.
After starting secukinumab, clinical and biological features improved, and complete kidney response was achieved.
