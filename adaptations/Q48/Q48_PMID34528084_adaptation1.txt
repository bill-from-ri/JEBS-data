I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

The objective of this study is to describe the relationship of how the drug called anifrolumab works with the effectiveness and safety in patients who have moderate to severe lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells) despite receiving standard therapy. The study uses data gathered from clinical study trials.
TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 are 52-week clinical trials of anifrolumab given through a vein every 4 weeks for 48 weeks.
Anifrolumab and placebo are compared using different assessment tools and analyses.
Relationships between exposure to the medication and key safety events are assessed graphically.
Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who received anifrolumab (a total of 447 patients receiving a dose amount of 150 or 300mg) or sham treatment/placebo (366 patients), 574 patients completed treatment.
In the exposure-effectiveness analyses, treatment differences favoring anifrolumab (at 300) vs placebo are observed across subgroups of the study participants and all analysis populations.
The concentration of the drug is found to be a significant factor for having a response, as higher anifrolumab in blood predicted greater effectiveness.
There is no evidence of key safety events from taking the drug through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg.
In conclusion, while higher concentration of the drug in blood predicted greater effectiveness, ongoing positive benefits of anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo is observed across subgroups in the TULIP trials.
There is no evidence of safety events from exposure to the drug.
