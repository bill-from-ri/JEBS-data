I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Objective: To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of belimumab and anifrolumab in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Materials and methods: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of belimumab 10 mg, anifrolumab 300 mg, and a placebo in patients with active SLE.
Results: Six RCTs (2,757 patients) were included in this study.
The response rate based on the SLE 4 Responder Index (SRI4) at 52 weeks was substantially higher in the belimumab 10-mg and anifrolumab 300-mg groups than that in the placebo group (OR 2.90, % credible intervals (CrIs) 2.37 - 3.56; OR 1.60, % CrI 1.22 - 2.08).
The SRI4 response rate for belimumab 10 mg was significantly higher than that for anifrolumab 300 mg (OR 1.82, 95% CrI 1.30 - 2.53).
Ranking probability based on surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that belimumab 10 mg was most likely the best treatment for SRI4 response (SUCRA = 0.999), followed by anifrolumab 300 mg (SUCRA = 0.500) and placebo (SUCRA = 0.001).
The number of serious adverse events (SAEs) did not differ significantly among the 4 treatment groups.
Conclusion: Based on the SRI4 response rate, belimumab 10 mg had the best response efficacy, followed by anifrolumab 10 mg.
However, there was no difference in the number of SAEs among the treatment options.
