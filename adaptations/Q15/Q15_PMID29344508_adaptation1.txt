How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Kidneys play a major role in the maintenance and control of acid-base homeostasis (having the right amount of acid and base in the blood and other body fluids) and electrolyte homeostasis (the correct concentration of different ions in the body, such as sodium and potassium), which is required for metabolism and other organ functions.
Chronic (long-lasting or recurring) kidney diseases weakens the regulatory functions and leads to changes in electrolyte and acid-base balance, which can be life-threatening.
In this review, researchers discuss renal (kidney-related) control functions of electrolyte and acid-base balance and several common disorders, such as disorders with too much acid or base in body fluids, or low potassium levels.
Common disorders in chronic kidney disease are also discussed.
The most recent and important advances on pathophysiology (functional changes that come with a particular syndrome or disease), clinical characteristics (symptoms and results from lab tests), diagnosis, and management of these conditions have been incorporated.
