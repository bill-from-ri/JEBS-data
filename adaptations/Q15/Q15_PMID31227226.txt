How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Total-body potassium (K+) content and appropriate distribution of K+ across the cell membrane is vitally important for normal cellular function.
Total-body K+ content is determined by changes in excretion of K+ by the kidneys in response to intake levels.
Under normal conditions, insulin and Î²-adrenergic tone also make important contributions in maintaining internal distribution of K+.
However, despite these homeostatic pathways, disorders of altered K+ homeostasis are common.
Appreciating the pathophysiology and regulatory influences that determine the internal distribution and external balance of K+ is critical in designing effective treatments to restore K+ homeostasis.
We provide an up-to-date review of the regulatory aspects of normal K+ physiology as a preface to highlighting common disorders in K+ homeostasis and their treatment.
This review of K+ homeostasis is designed as a resource for clinicians and a tool for educators who are teaching trainees to understand the pivotal factors involved in K+ balance.
