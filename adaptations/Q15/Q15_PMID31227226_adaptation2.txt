How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Full-body potassium (K+) content and appropriate distribution of K+ across cell boudaries is important for normal cellular function.
Total-body K+ content is measured by changes in the removal of K+ by the kidneys in response to intake levels.
Normally, insulin (a blood sugar-monitoring protein) and nerve-related, stimulating activity also contribute to maintaing internal potassium distribution.
Despite these balance-maintaining pathways, disorders of altered potassium balance are common.
Understanding the biological distribution and balance of K+ is crucial to designing treatments for it.
We review the current biology of K+ to introduce common disorders in K+ balance and their treatment.
