How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Past studies describe a new process to transport and reabsorb sodium and chloride ions (atoms or molecules that carry electrical charges) from one side of the cell to the other. One is called the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) that is a protein that exchanges Na+ (sodium) from outside the cell for Cl- (chloride) that is in the cell.
There is no lab or test tube experiments that show evidence for the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in maintaining a sodium balance.
In this present study, researchers show that reducing Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger in mice causes only minor disruptions of sodium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal sodium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Researchers provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells) compensated for the lack of action of the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger.
To understand the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger, researchers generated an experiment with Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice, mice without NCC or NDCBE.
On a normal diet, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout and single-knockout mice showed similar activation of the hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and some heart-related function; however, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed lower potassium in the blood.
Also, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed an increase in the surface sodium channels (ENaC) and the potassium channel Ca2+-activated K+ channels BKCa.
When sodium-chloride is depleted, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice developed altered blood volume contraction, despite increased kidney activity.
Notably, the increase in aldosterone (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels) expected from the sodium-chloride loss was weakened in Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice. Single knock-out and Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice had similar blood potassium concentrations when this occurred.
In conclusion, the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and volume of blood when salt is reduced or when Na+/Cl- cotransporter Is turned off in mice.
Furthermore, Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger has an important role in preventing hypokalemia (low levels of potassium).
Because Na+/Cl- cotransporter and Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger are both targets of thiazide targets (which reduces sodium reabsorption), the combined slowing of Na+/Cl- cotransporter and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger/pendrin system (a multifaceted transporter that plays important roles in various functions of the kidney) may explain thiazide generated hypokalemia in some patients.
