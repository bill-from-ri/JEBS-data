How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

There is a lot of potassium (a mineral the body needs to function well) in the fluid within cells. It plays a key role in the maintenance of normal cell functions and processes.
Therefore, potassium homeostasis (the correct balance of potassium in the body that is important for cell function) is very critical because a change in this balance can lead to different diseases, some that are life-threatening.
Oxidative stress (a condition that happens when the body has low antioxidant levels,  vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells), and potassium imbalance (levels of potassium that are not normal) can cause life threatening health conditions.
Oxidative stress and changes in how potassium passes through cells are reported in neurodegenerative diseases (diseases such as Alzheimer's where nerve cells deteriorate or die).
This review highlights the major factors involved in potassium homeostasis such as food and genes. It also discusses major diseases associated with potassium imbalance including hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and chronic kidney disease.
