What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

Each year, 4 to 5 million newborns receive state-mandated screening.
The Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children has identified 34 main conditions that should be included in screening programs. However, each state manages, funds, and maintains its own program.
State programs include screening, as well as the diagnosis and coordination of care for newborns with positive test results.
Testing for the main disorders is fairly standardized, but more extensive screening varies widely by state. Additionally, the rigorous evaluation of new screening panels is ongoing.
The standard group of tests includes testing for three main categories of disorders: metabolic disorders, problems with hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood) and a group of assorted conditions, including congenital hearing loss.
Family doctors need to be familiar with the expanded newborn screening tests to effectively communicate the results to parents, and to create plans of action.
These doctors also need to recognize signs of metabolic disorders that may not be detected by screening tests or that may not be a part of standard newborn screening in their state.
For infants with positive screening results that lead to a diagnosis, long-term follow-up involves ongoing parental education, regular exams, and management at a metabolic treatment center. Long-term follow-up also involves tests of brain development to detect relevant disorders in time for early action.
