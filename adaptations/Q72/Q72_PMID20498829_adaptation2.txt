What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

Many disorders (but mostly ones that are inherited) can be detected early by looking at dried blood spot samples of newborns across the population.
Phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that can cause many issues with the brain. This disorder was the original example of how newborn screening can result in big improvements for health outcomes.
After improved lab tests for hypothyroidism (a gland disorder) and Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an inherited disorder that causes lung infections, these diseases were added to newborn screening programs.
Current testing for CF usually relies on a combination of testing for genetic mutations that cause CF and testing for an enzyme that is reduced by CF.
Combined testing for about 25 genetic mutations relating to metabolism is a relatively recent addition to newborn screening.
The addition of many disorders all at once has led to some reconsideration of the way newborn screening is usually done. This is because it is easy to include tests for disorders that are very rare or don’t have good treatments.
Newborn screening for many other disorders have been developed, but these aren’t applied as evenly or are consider to be still under development.
This article focuses on newborn screening practices in Australasia.
