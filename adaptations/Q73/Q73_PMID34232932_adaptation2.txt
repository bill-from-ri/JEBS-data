In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Using several types of pain treatment at once has become the standard way to care for patients having joint replacement surgery. This is because this approach reduces pain better with fewer side effects than only using opioids.
Some pain medicines affect the whole body, including NSAIDs, Tylenol®, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids (such as Lyrica or Neurontin). These medicines, local anesthetics, and peripheral nerve blocks, are the foundation of the multi-pronged approach for joint replacement surgery.
Ideally, this multi-pronged approach should start before the operation and continue throughout the time of surgery and beyond discharge.
There is not enough evidence to be in favor of the routine use of IV Tylenol® or liposomal bupivacaine (a type of local anesthetic) as part of multi-pronged pain treatment approaches.
