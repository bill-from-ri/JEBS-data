In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Options for managing pain after surgery are very important for patients having a hip replacement. This is because joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures.
This study shows pain outcome until 4 weeks after surgery and evaluates factors that influence pain during followup after a hip replacement.
This was a study that followed a group of patients over time. It included a total of 103 patients that had a hip replacement.
Pain following surgery was described using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Demographic information and ways in which the surgery was done were correlated with the amount of pain after surgery.
Looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week after surgery (average NRS 3.1 on day 1 to average NRS 2.3 on day 8). After that, there was a continuous increase for 3 days (average NRS 2.6 on day 9 to average NRS 2.3 on day 12).
Afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean NRS 0.9 on day 29).
No correlation was found between the potential factors of sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, ASA score (used to measure fitness for surgery), and pain levels following the operation. However, a there was a significant correlation between pain levels before surgery and after.
In conclusion, pain levels increased after the first week following surgery, for 3 days. This is most likely caused by the change to more extensive mobilization and physiotherapy in the rehabilitation unit.
We did not find any significant association of several potential predictors with the intensity of pain following surgery. The only exception was the amount of pain before surgery.
When managing pain, doctors need to account for these results in the future. This is needed to further increase patients' satisfaction following hip replacement and to adapt pain management programs.
