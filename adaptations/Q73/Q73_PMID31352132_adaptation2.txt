In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Taking care of pain after knee replacement and and hip replacement is critical because it determines the how the patient recovers after surgery.
Ways of controlling pain that are not effective causes many additional problems after surgery and hinders successful recovery.
In recent years, changing from opioids after knee and hip replacement to using multiple pain medicines at once has increasingly become an alternative.
This is because of the many side effects of opioids.
As a result, the use of non-opioid treatments and techniques such as peripheral nerve block, which directly numbs a large nerve, and local anesthetic have become more favorable. Non-opioid treatments include acetaminophen (TylenolÂ®), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, gabapentinoids (such as Lyrica or Neurontin), and ketamine.
This paper aims to summarize literature about the effectiveness of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain management plan after knee and hip replacement.
We reviewed the scientific research on pain management to improve recovery following surgery. We did this to provide evidence-based information with respect to this pain management.
The scientific papers we chose were taken from several electronic databases.
We found 27 articles that met our standards for being included in this review.
Evidence in scientific literature shows that non-opioid pain treatments such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, ketamine, peripheral nerve blocks, and local anesthesia benefit patients after knee and hip replacement.
However, further quality research trials are needed to be more sure.
In conclusion, certain scientific research papers support the use of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain medication plan for effective pain management after knee and hip replacement.
