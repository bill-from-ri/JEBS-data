In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) a method for managing pain and encouraging walking early after joint surgery. It involves injecting several painkillers directly into the surgical wound during and after the procedure. We applied LIA and have found more and more that patients are able to go home earlier.
This study uses national data on hip and knee surgery provided by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Medibank Private. It compares the national data with our outcomes using LIA and rapid recovery.
This study followed patients over time and was done by one surgeon. It included surgery on knees and 165 hips in the two years leading up to June 2016.
We compared the two groups using several factors. These included length of stay, number of patients either transferred to rehabilitation or intensive care unit (ICU) or readmitted within 30 days, and average total cost upon leaving the hospital.
We found that the average length of stay for hip replacement in our data was nights, compared to five nights for national data. Inpatient rehabilitation was 7% versus 36%, ICU admission was zero versus 4%, and readmission rate was 4% versus 6%. The average total cost on leaving the hospital was $17,813 for our data, versus $26,734 for national data.
For knee replacement, we found that the average length of stay in our study was one night versus five nights for national data. Rate of transfer to ICU was 0.5% versus 3% Rate of transfer to rehabilitation was 4.5% versus 43%. The rate of patient readmission was 6% versus 7%, and the average total cost upon leaving the hospital in our group was $16,437 versus $27,505 for the national data.
In conclusion, the comprehensive approach of LIA and rapid recovery allows patients to have shorter hospitalization, lower rates of rehabilitation and, as a result, a reduction in healthcare expenses.
