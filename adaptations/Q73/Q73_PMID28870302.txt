In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Total hip and knee arthroplasty is associated with significant perioperative pain, which can adversely affect recovery by increasing risk of complications, length of stay, and cost.
Historically, opioids were the mainstay of perioperative pain control.
However, opioids are associated with significant downsides.
Preemptive use of a multimodal pain management approach has become the standard of care to manage pain after hip and knee arthroplasty.
Multimodal pain management uses oral medicines, peripheral nerve blocks, intra-articular injections, and other tools to reduce the need for opioids.
Use of a multimodal approach promises to decrease complications, improve outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction after hip and knee arthroplasty.
