What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

This study evaluated the impact of tumor shrinkage (TS) caused by molecular targeted therapy as the first-line systemic (full-body) therapy on the survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). mRCC is kidney cancer that has spread to other organs. Molecular targeted therapy is a treatment type that uses drugs to target specific molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.
A total of 67 patients with mRCC who received molecular targeted therapy were included in this study.
Sixty patients were evaluated by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors.
Patients underwent the first evaluation at 8-12 weeks after the start of the therapy.
Twenty patients had TS ≧ 30%, 32 from 30% to -20%, and 8 ≦ -20%.
The median (average) overall survival periods of patients who achieved TS ≧30%, from 30% to -20%, and ≦-20% at first evaluation were 41.0, 35.0, and 11.5 months, respectively.
Analyses showed that TS of ≧0%, partnered with negative C-reactive protein and the absence of bone metastasis (cancer spreading), were good predictors of overall survival. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
The patients who achieved 0% or more at the initial evaluation had longer survival times than those who had no tumor reduction.
These findings suggest that early TS affects overall survival in real practice.
Alternative therapies should be considered for patients who have not achieved tumor reduction at the initial evaluation.
