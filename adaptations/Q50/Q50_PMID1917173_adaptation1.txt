What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

This study evaluated the short- and long-term outcome of 42 patients with distal type aortic dissection. Distal type aortic dissection is when an injury occurs to the inner layer of the aorta (main artery of the body), and blood flows between the layers of the aortic wall.
Twenty-eight patients underwent intensive medical therapy within two weeks after the onset of pain (acute dissection).
The remaining 14 patients had chronic dissection, meaning they were treated after more than 2 weeks had passed since pain onset (started).
The goals of treatment were to control blood pressure and to attain a negative (no detected) C-reactive protein test result. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
Hospital survival rate in the patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28).
There were several complications that occurred in-hospital during treatment. These complications include changes in mental status, kidney dysfunction, bradycardia (low heart rate), low blood pressure, and liver dysfunction. All of these complications were managed medically.
Three of these patients underwent surgical therapy in the chronic phase and were discharged without issue.
Fifteen of the 24 medically treated patients were discharged with negative C-reactive protein tests.
Spontaneous resolution of a dissection was demonstrated by x-rays in 8 cases.
Nearly all of the 24 medically treated patients had five-year survival rates.
Hospital survival rate in the patients with chronic dissection was 100%.
Strict control of blood pressure and evaluation of the dissection by x-rays and C-reactive protein tests provide acceptable outcomes of patients with acute distal dissection. These measures eliminate the need for emergency surgical intervention.
