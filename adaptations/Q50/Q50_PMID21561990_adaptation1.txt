What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

Fever after heart surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection. The fever may also be caused by a noninfectious origin like systemic (full-body) inflammatory (infection-fighting) response syndrome (SIRS).
A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is important.
The aim of this study was to evaluate, in the period after heart surgery, whether measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can help detect bacterial infection. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
Children who underwent heart surgery with bypass (diverted blood flow) were tested for serum (blood) levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days after surgery and/or when they had a fever.
Evidence was compared among three patient groups. The groups include: patients with fever with proven bacterial infection (FWI group), febrile (near-fever) patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group).
In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group.
Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years.
There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after.
A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by the FWI group compared with the FNI group.
Mean CRP velocity was significantly higher in the infectious group than in the fever-only group.
Specific CRP velocity could positively predict bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity (accuracy).
Serial (consistent) measurements of CRP/CRP velocity after heart surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating (identifying) post-operation fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.
