What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

Background: Corona virus disease 2019 has become a global health issue.
The goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with corona virus disease 2019 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and identify factors associated with mortality.
Methods: Ninety four consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this retrospective, single-center, observational study.
The outcome variable was mortality of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and factors associated with it during intensive care unit stay.
Results: Seventy nine (84%) out of 94 patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation didn't survive.
Ninety four percent of patients who had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus did not survive in comparison to 72 percent of patients who didn't have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
Similarly, 48 (94.1%) out of 51 patients with a positive C-reactive protein value didn't survive in comparison to 31 (72%) out of 43 patients with a negative C-reactive protein.
Conclusions: The presence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and a positive C-reactive protein value were strongly associated with mortality.
Patients with a Sequential organ failure assessment score of more than eight at intensive care unit admission and peak D-dimer level of more than or equal to two during intensive care unit stay didn't show significant association with mortality.
These findings need further exploration through larger prospective studies.
