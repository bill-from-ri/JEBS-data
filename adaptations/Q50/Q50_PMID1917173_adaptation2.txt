What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

We analyzed the short- and long-term outcome of 42 patients with distal type aortic dissection (a tear in the major blood vessel near the heart).
Twenty-eight patients underwent intense treatment within two weeks after the start of pain (acute dissection or immediate rupture).
The remaining 14 patients had long-lasting dissection or gradual breakdown of the major blood vessel near the heart.
The goals of treatment were to control blood pressure and detect no C-reactive protein (a measure of inflammation).
Hospital survival rate in patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28).
In-hospital issues included changes in mental status, kidney dysfunction, slowed heart beat, low blood pressure from standing, and liver dysfunction, all of which were managed medically.
Three of these patients had surgery in the long-lasting phase and were released without issue.
Fifteen (62.5%) of the 24 medically treated patients were released with no C-reactive protein detected.
Random solving of a dissection (tear) was demonstrated by medical imaging in 8 cases.
Five-year survival rates in 24 medically treated patients was 93%.
Hospital survival rate in patients with long-lasting dissection was 100% (14/14).
The rigorous control of blood pressure in the immediate phase, and subsequent monitoring of the dissection or tear by imaging and C-reactive protein tests provide good short- and long-term outcomes of patients with immediate distal dissection without emergency surgery.
