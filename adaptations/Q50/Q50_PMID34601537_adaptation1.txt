What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

Corona virus disease 2019, or COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), has become a global health issue.
The goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (being helped to breathe by a machine). This study also aimed to identify factors associated with death.
Ninety four critically ill COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this study.
The studied variable of interest was death of the patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and factors associated with death during intensive care unit stay.
Seventy nine out of 94 patients with COVID-19 who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation didn't survive.
Ninety four percent of patients who had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus did not survive. This is compared to 72% of patients who didn't have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
Similarly, 48 out of 51 patients with a positive C-reactive protein value didn't survive in comparison to 31 out of 43 patients with a negative C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
The presence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and a positive C-reactive protein value were strongly associated with death.
Patients with a Sequential organ failure assessment score, a ranking system to determine patient's organ function, of >8 at ICU admission and peak D-dimer (protein fragment from dissolved blood clotting) level of â‰¥ 2 during ICU stay didn't show significant association with death.
These findings need further exploration in larger studies.
