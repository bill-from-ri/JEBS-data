What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

The role of undetected infection within the uterus in preterm labor (between week 20 and 27 of pregnancy) was evaluated in 40 patients and control subjects.
The 24 preterm labor patients with a negative (no detection) C-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis, a procedure to delay delivery, most of the time. These patients had an average delay of delivery for 35.5 days and an average gestational (pregnant) age of 36.9 weeks. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
The 16 patients with a positive (with detection of) C-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis less than half of the time. These patients had an average delay of delivery of 14.4 days and an average gestational age of 33.2 weeks.
Evidence of chorioamnionitis, an infection within the membranes surrounding a fetus, was present in 32.9% of 310 preterm deliveries. Evidence of chorioamnionitis was only found in 22.3% of 1631 term deliveries.
The presence of undetected infection must be considered in cases of preterm labor, especially among patients for whom tocolytic therapy is unsuccessful.
