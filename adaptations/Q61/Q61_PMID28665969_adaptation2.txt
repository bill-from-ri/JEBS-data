Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

New treatments are needed for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) that causes cold sores or genital herpes.
Pomegranate is considered to help against infection since ancient times.
We studied the activity of pomegranate rind extract (PRE)  combined with zinc.
PKE and zinc salts were used against different types of HSV.
Toxic effect on cells was measured by identifying working cells using commercial chemicals. 
Zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate worked similarly against HSV that causes cold sores, and increased the effect of PKE up to 4-fold.
Punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective against the virus than an equivalent amount of PKE.
Punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective killing the virus than an equivalent amount of PKE.
Punicalagin was less effective than PKE in fighting the virus and suppressing its growth. PKE was comparable to the drug aciclovir. PKE also worked against the viruses that are resistant to aciclovir. 
Zinc sulfate did not affect how PKE worked against the virus and its growth. 
None of the zinc-PKE combinations had toxic effects on cells.
Zinc increases PKE ability to kill viral cells. The combination could become a new treatment applied locally to cold sores.
