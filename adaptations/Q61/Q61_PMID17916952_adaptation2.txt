Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Zinc is considered to get into the body easily when taken as yeast enriched with zinc or zinc gluconate.
These two supplements have not been compared to each other. 
We study if zinc gets into the body of healthy male volunteers better when given with yeast compared to zinc gluconate. 
The volunteers took the two supplements sequentially, in no particular order.
We examined urine, blood and stools over 48 hours after volunteers took a single dose of supplement.
We measured the total amount of zinc and its availability in the body.
There was no difference in getting the two supplements out of the body through urine.
There was more zinc in the blood in the first six hours after taking zinc gluconate, but more of it was removed with the stools. 
Zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but was removed less with the stools.
The amount of zinc in the body 48 hours after taking zinc yeast was high, but after zinc gluconate the body lost more zinc than it had before. 
Organic zinc yeast supplements provide the body with more zinc than the zinc gluconate salts.
