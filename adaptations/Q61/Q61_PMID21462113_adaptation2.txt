Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Unlike iron, zinc gets into the body proportionately to taking it in with food, not depending on zinc presence in the body.
As the amount of zinc in the food increases, the total amount of zinc that the body takes in increases, while the proportion of zinc that the body takes in goes down. 
The digestive system maintains the balance of zinc in the body by adjusting how much zinc it removes from the body while taking in zinc from the food.
If the amount of zinc in food is below 9 milligrams a day, the body uses special chemicals to take zinc into the body.
The process of taking in zinc does not depend on how much zinc the body took in the past or currently has. 
Instead, zinc consumed with food determines how much zinc will get into the body.
Zinc supplements taken with water get into the body more efficiently than food zinc. This efficiency goes down within 24 hours, maybe because the body slows down the special chemicals that take zinc in.
