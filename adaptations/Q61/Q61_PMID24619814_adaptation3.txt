Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Men collect the most zinc in their prostate.
The amount of zinc in the body decreases as a person gets older.
Taking zinc pills protects the body from chemical imbalance and lessens the risk of cancer.
The two types of zinc pills most often studied are zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate.
This study compared the different types of zinc pills and doses when taken by rats for 30 days.
The results show that the amount of zinc in prostate was different depending on the type of zinc pill taken.
The rats had a lot more zinc in their prostates when taking zinc gluconate and zinc citrate compared to rats that did not take any zinc pills.
The amount of zinc in the prostate was high even when the rats took zinc gluconate at the lowest dose. 
There was no increase of zinc in rats that took zinc sulfate.
To sum up, zinc gluconate is a worthwhile zinc pill for men who need more zinc.
