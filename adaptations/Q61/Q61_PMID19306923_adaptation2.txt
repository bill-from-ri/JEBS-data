Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Much attention is given to toxic effect of zinc on the neural system, but little is known about about the other chemicals that accompany zinc. 
We study how different zinc salts affect nerve cells' ability to work and live.
In very small doses, zinc salts were no toxic, except for zinc-citrate.
At higher doses of all salts except of zinc-histidinate, the levels of protective cell chemicals decreased and the cells died. 
Zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate turned out to be the most toxic salts particularly at low doses.
Depending on the dose and type of salt, cells die of different combinations of lack of blood supply to the cell or a pre-determined cell death mechanism. 
Zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate provided free zinc in higher doses then other salts, possibly indicating there is a connection between taking in zinc and its toxic effect on the cell. 
Zinc salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride, zinc-gluconate) and low cell totoxicity (zinc-histidinate).
