Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Prostate, a a small gland below the bladder that helps men make semen, contains the highest amount of zinc in the body.
The amount of zinc available to the body decreases with age.
Taking zinc supplements may protect the body against damage caused by the environment and reduces the risk of cancer.
The most frequently discussed supplements are zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate 
We compare the amounts of available zinc in the prostate of male rats after giving them three different doses of zinc sulfate, zinc gluconate, or zinc citrate for 30 days. 
The availability of zinc in the prostate was very different for different zinc supplements.
The availability of zinc in rat prostate was higher only after taking zinc gluconate and zinc citrate.
For zinc gluconate, the availability was higher even at the lowest dose. 
In the rats that got zinc sulfate, availability of zinc has not increased in some parts of the prostate.
To sum up, zinc gluconate is worth considering as a zinc supplement for men.
