Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

This study compared three different types of zinc drugs. The study included 15 healthy people.
The people were divided into four groups.
Each group took a different type of zinc pill each week for four weeks. The zinc pill types were zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc gluconate, and a fake zinc pill.
Researchers measured the amount of zinc in each person's hair, urine, red blood cells, and blood each week.
There was more zinc in each person's body after a week of taking the zinc picolinate pills.
Those people taking zinc gluconate, zinc citrate, or the fake zinc pills did not have more zinc in their body after a week of taking the pills.
The researchers found a very small increase of zinc in the blood of people after the a week of taking the zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, or fake zinc pills.
This means that zinc picolinate is the best pill to take to get more zinc into a person's body.
