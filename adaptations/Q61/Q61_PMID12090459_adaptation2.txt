Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Zinc is known to interfere with volatile sulphur compounds, chemicals that have rotten egg smell and barnyard smell. 
We studied which zinc salts are better to use in zinc lozenges.
Some zinc salts break down in water more easily and let out more free zinc.  
We prepared similar lozenges that contained one of the zinc salts that easily let out zinc (zinc acetate or zinc gluconate) or the chemicals that do not let zinc out easily (zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc). 
All the lozenges contained a hundredth part of zinc.
10 volunteers used the different lozenges in no particular order.
We measured the poor smelling sulfur gases.
All lozenges worked similarly. 
This means that suppression of the sulfur chemicals by zinc is not related to how easily zinc salts dissolve in water. 
Similar results for all lozenges may be due to some chemicals in the mouth interacting with zinc stronger than the salts in the lozenges.
Lab experiments suggest the chemical in the mouth that interacts with zinc may be a form of sulfur.
