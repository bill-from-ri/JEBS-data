Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Zinc salts that dissolve in water are commonly used as supplements. Tablets or syrup with zinc  gluconate, zinc sulfate or zinc acetate are used to prevent zinc deficiency and to treat diarrhea (Loose stools) in children. 
Another source of zinc is zinc citrate that somewhat dissolves in water. It tastes better in syrups, but it is not known if it gets into the body. 
We measured how much zinc gets into the body of 15 healthy adults after they took zinc supplements without food. The supplements were zinc citrate, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide, which does not mix with water).
Same as for zinc gluconate, about half of the zinc from zinc citrate got into the body.
Much smaller amounts of zinc got into the body from zinc oxide.
Three people did not get any zinc from zinc oxide.
Zinc citrate supplement taken without food  provided as much zinc to healthy adults as zinc gluconate. It may be another useful supplement for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea.
Zinc oxide, which doesn't mix with water, does not get into the body that well, or not at all in some people.
