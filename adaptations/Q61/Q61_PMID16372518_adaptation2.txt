Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Zinc supplements help with some problems, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can blur vision.
How much zinc gets into the body may depend on the form in which zinc is taken.
We compared the movement of zinc in the body after taking zinc gluconate  or zinc oxide.
12 healthy males 21 to 31 years old took zinc gluconate and zinc oxide for 14 days each, waiting for at least 14 days between switching to the other supplement. 
Zinc levels were measured in their blood.
The highest level of zinc in the blood was higher for zinc gluconate as compared to zinc oxide.
The levels of zinc in the blood were higher after zinc was given as zinc gluconate when compared to zinc oxide, but the time it took to reach the highest levels was the same.
Getting zinc into human bodies could be improved by using zinc gluconate.
