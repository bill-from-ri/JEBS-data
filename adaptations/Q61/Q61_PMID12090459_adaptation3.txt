Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Zinc's anti-VSC (volatile sulphur compounds) effect comes from free zinc ions, which are the chemicals that allow zinc to work in the body.
The objective of this study was to see which type of zinc lozenges work best, the type that has what is called high stability constants or the type that has low stability constants. 
A lot of free zinc ions appear when low stability constant zinc is dissolved in water, which high stability constant zinc gives few ions.
All lozenges looked identical but contained one of four different types of zinc forms, two for each type of stability constants.
All of the lozenges contained a small amount of zinc.
10 volunteers took the different lozenges randomly.

The results show that the zinc lozenges were effective no matter the stability constant.
The stability constant has no effect on the zinc ions' anti-VSC effect.
One explanation is that free zinc ions are attracted to chemicals in the mouth more strongly than those in the lozenge.
A lab experiment showed that sulphide ions from VSCs may attract free zinc ions to create the anti-VSC effect.
