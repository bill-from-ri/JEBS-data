Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Research is focused on the ways that zinc is bad for the body's cells, but researchers don't how everything works.
This study looks at how various forms of zinc effect cells in the body by testing the zinc on rat cells.
The various forms of zinc did not have bad effects on the cells when used at small sizes, except for the form called zinc citrate.
All of the various forms of zinc caused cells to die at high amounts except for the form called zinc histidinate.
The most toxic of the zinc forms were zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate. They had bad effects even when used in low amounts.
The type of zinc and how much was used affected the way cells died.
The cells absorbed more zinc from the zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate forms. This means that there may be a relationship between the amount of zinc absorbed and how bad it is for the cells.
The forms of zinc can be divided into three different categories based on how toxic they are to cells.
