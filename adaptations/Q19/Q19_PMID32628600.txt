Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

A vast advancement has been made in the treatment related to central nervous system disorders especially Parkinson's disease.
The development in therapeutics and a better understanding of the targets results in upsurge of many promising therapies for Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease is defined by neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation and it is reported that the presence of the neurofibrillary aggregates such as Lewy bodies is considered as the marker.
Along with this, it is also characterized by the presence of motor and non-motor symptoms, as seen in Parkinsonian patients.
A lot of treatment options mainly focus on prophylactic measures or the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the point of interest which can be exploited as a new target to emphasis on Parkinson's disease.
A thorough study of these targets helps in modifications of those molecules which are particularly involved in causing the neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease.
A lot of drug regimens are available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, although levodopa remains the choice of drug for controlling the symptoms, yet is accompanied with significant snags.
It is always suggested to use other drug therapies concomitantly with levodopa.
A number of significant causes and therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease have been identified in the last decade, here an attempt was made to highlight the most significant of them.
It was also found that the treatment regimen and involvement of therapies are totally dependent on individuals and can be tailored to the needs of each individual patient.
