Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

Parkinson's disease is diagnosed when bradykinesia (slowness of movement) occurs together with rigidity or tremors, along with other characteristics.
The diagnosis is based on the signs, symptoms, and health history of the patient. Attention should be paid to other criteria that might indicate another diagnosis and to 'red flag' (investigate further) features.
There is no cure or treatment that can reduce the activity and progression for Parkinson's disease, and the rate of progression varies among patients.
The most effective treatment to help symptoms is levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine), which has superior benefits for quality of life in early Parkinson's disease compared to other therapies.
Changes in the ability to move and dyskinesia (involuntary and uncontrollable movements) later in the disease's development can be improved by adding another treatment that assists the primary treatment.
Around 10% of patients per year with motor (movement) changes that are not responding to treatment may be able to take advanced therapies, including deep-brain stimulation surgery (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain).
There is emerging evidence for the management of non-motor symptoms (symptoms unrelated to movement such as lack of pain or tiredness) in Parkinson's disease, and the importance of multidisciplinary care (when professionals from different fields work together to deliver comprehensive care that addresses the patient's needs).
In this article, the evidence foundation for the best diagnosis and care of Parkinson's disease is discussed.
