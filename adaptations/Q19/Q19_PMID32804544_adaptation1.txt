Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) is slowed down by motor (movement) complications related to the inability of neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement) and use it appropriately.
This problem often leads to delaying the use of levodopa and using dopamine agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine), which directly stimulates dopamine receptors or target sites in the brain.
Using dopamine agonists, however, is connected with multiple side effects. Their performance is limited by the drug not being completely available to the intended part of the body.
This paper reviews the latest findings from animal and human studies on the performance and negative effects of non-ergot dopamine agonists (newer types of drugs that imitate the effects of dopamine), discussing the present and future of this type of drug in Parkinson's disease.
The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of dopamine agonists as the first treatment and as an additional drug to use with levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease, but a more moderate approach to their use is emerging due to their side effects.
As different factors may increase the risk to side effects, evaluating such risk and adjusting the use of dopamine agonists may become extremely important in the care of Parkinson's disease, as well as the availability of new dopamine agonists drugs with better safety and performance documented.
