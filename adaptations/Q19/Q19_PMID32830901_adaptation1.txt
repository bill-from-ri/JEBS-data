Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

Dopamine is a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement. The breakdown and inactivation of dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be addressed by increased cognitive (thought-related) control brought about by cholinergic mechanisms (types of drugs that inhibit, enhance, or imitate the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary signaling molecule of nerve cells).
Shift to cognitive control of walking can be measured by prefrontal cortex activation (activating the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making).
Levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) improves certain aspects of gait (how a person walks) and worsens others. Cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear.
This study examines dopaminergic (drugs that increase dopamine activity) and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD.
A clinical study examines the effects of levodopa and donepezil (a type of drug that helps mental function) in Parkinson's disease.
In this study, 20 people with Parkinson's disease were randomly put in treatment groups, and 19 completed the study.
Participants were randomly put in either the group that received both levodopa + donepezil or the group that received levodopa + placebo (sham) treatments, with 2 weeks spent on treatment and a 2-week washout (the study phase when the drug is stopped and no other drug is used).
The main outcome (result) is change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking. Secondary outcomes are change in gait, dual-task performance (doing two tasks at the same time), and attention.
Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity (the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making) compared with off medication, whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease.
Gait speed and stride length while doing single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication.
Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication, and accuracy improved with the combined donepezil and levodopa drugs.
Cholinergic drugs, specifically donepezil for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in Parkinson's disease.
Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.
