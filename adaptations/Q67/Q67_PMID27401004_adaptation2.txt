How much physical therapy for knee replacement is needed?

The aim of this study was to see how effective and safe different functional recovery strategies were immediately after discharge from knee replacement surgery. It compared non-supervised, home-based exercise to individualized and supervised programs delivered in clinic-based settings.
We searched several medical literature databases for papers published up until April 2015. We were looking for clinical trials of home-based exercise programs versus individualized and supervised outpatient physical therapy (PT) after knee replacement.
The outcomes we compared were knee range of motion (ROM), patient-reported pain and function, functional performance, and safety.



Our search and selection process found 11 clinical trials of decent quality but that looked at small numbers of patients.
Seven studies, with a total of 707 patients, had data on ROM for extending the leg that could be used. Nine studies, with a total of 983 patients, had data on ROM for bending the leg.
Most studies showed no difference between groups.
Even taken altogether, differences between the treatment types were small enough to be by chance.

In conclusion, short-term improvements in physical function and knee ROM are not clearly different between outpatient PT and home-based exercise regimes in patients after knee replacement. However, this conclusion is based on combining studies with many differences.
