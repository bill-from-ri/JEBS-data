How much physical therapy for knee replacement is needed?

Although knee replacement surgery is very common and usually turns out well, amount of function after varies widely.
Most patients have some physical therapy (PT) after knee replacement, but PT practice varies. We donâ€™t know which amounts and kinds of PT are associated with which outcomes.
Research has shown that exercise is associated with better outcomes, but studies have not looked at whether this has made its way into clinical practice.
We looked at the content, amount, and progression of usual PT services after knee replacement. We also examined associations of specific details of PT after surgery with how much function patients had after 6 months.
We collected PT data from patients who were having knee replacement surgery on one side and participating in a clinical trial of a phone-based coaching program.
We reviewed PT records from final sessions to find how much patients used the PT and what exercises were done.
We used statistical methods to see which parts of PT treatment were associated with 6-month outcomes.
In all, we looked at 112 records from 30 PT sites.
The types and amounts of exercises, and how they progressed, varied widely.
Exercises that used weights or other resistance were use more than body-weight exercises (on average 21 versus 13).
Progression of exercises was used on average 0 times for exercises with resistance and 1 time for exercises that just used body weight.
Climbing stairs faster was associated with more PT sessions and the use and progression of body-weight exercises.
The evidence suggests that treatments backed by studies are not used as much as they should be and the amount of PT may not be enough to create the best possible outcomes.
