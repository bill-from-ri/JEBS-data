How much physical therapy for knee replacement is needed?

Complete knee replacement surgery is the best known treatment for severe arthritis in the knee.
Most patients have successful long-term outcomes and reduced pain after knee replacement. However, recovery varies, and most patients continue to have weakness in the legs and less function compared to peers of the same age.
There is a potential positive influence of rehab after surgery and a lack of established standards for prescribing exercise paradigms after knee replacement. With this in mind, our goal in this review article was to look carefully at studies to determine how effective outpatient care is for regaining function short-term and long-term.
We found 19 studies that we deemed very relevant for the review. We discussed four categories of treatment after surgery: 1) strengthening exercises; 2) aquatic therapy; 3) balance training; and 4) clinical environment.
The best outpatient physical therapy strategies should include strengthening and intensive functional exercises, either normal or in water. The intensity of these should increase based on patient progress.
Since these exercises are very individualized, outpatient physical therapy done in a clinic under with a trained physical therapist may provide the best long-term outcomes after the surgery.
Supervised or remotely supervised therapy may be effective at reducing some of the impairments following knee replacement, but several studies without direct oversight had poor results.
Most studies did not accurately describe what “usual care” was used to compare against the programs they were testing. Information about the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of the rehab protocols was also missing from several studies.
