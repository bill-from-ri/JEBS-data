How much physical therapy for knee replacement is needed?

Physical therapy (PT) is often given to patients that had knee replacement after after leaving the hospital.
PT after leaving the hospital is thought to be helpful, especially for patients with high risk of bad outcomes. These are patients with persistent pain that impairs function, even though the surgery seemed to go well.
Research teams have done 3 large-scale trials across different health care facilities, designed specifically for patients at risk of poor outcome following knee replacement.
All 3 trials checked for poor outcome risk using different methods and looked at different ways for physical therapists to try to help.
Despite the variety of types of physical therapy and how they were given, all trials found no effects of the enhanced treatment compared with usual care.
In all cases, usual care required a lower amount of physical therapy compared with the enhanced interventions.
This article expresses our opinions on recent research. It compares and contrasts the 3 trials, guesses what could explain the findings that there were no effects, and proposes areas for future studies that could help the people at high risk of bad outcomes.
