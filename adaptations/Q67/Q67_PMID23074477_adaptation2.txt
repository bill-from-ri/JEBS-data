How much physical therapy for knee replacement is needed?

The goal of this health technology policy analysis was to figure out, where, how, and when physiotherapy (PT) can best help patients after knee or hip replacement. We also hope to figure out the financial impact of the best PT strategies for Ontario.
Specifically, we wanted to figure out how inpatient PT (during a stay at a care facility) compared with outpatient PT, either at a clinic or at home, for patients that had joint replacements.
We also wanted to see how effective outpatient PT with a therapist was, either at a clinic or at home, compared with just a home exercise program for patients that had joint replacements.
Finally, we aimed to figure out how effective it is to exercise before surgery for people who are scheduled for knee or hip replacement.
Based on the evidence, the Medical Advisory Secretariat concluded that there is good evidence to support using home-based PT instead of inpatient PT after hip or knee replacement. This was concluded with regard to function a year after the surgery.
There is some evidence from one large study that getting phone call from a physiotherapist and practicing home exercises is comparable to having PT at a clinic and practicing home exercises for people who have had knee replacement.
However, the same might not apply to those who have hip replacement.
There is decent evidence that an exercise program beginning 4 to 6 weeks before knee replacement surgery is not effective.
