Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

Dialysis patients cannot distance themselves socially.
They are at high risk of developing COVID-19 with high mortality.
We studied Moderna boosters 6 months after two doses of Pfizer in 194 dialysis patients who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We measured the chemicals that protect against the COVID-19 virus 4 weeks after Pfizer and Moderna boosters, and also 10-12 weeks after Pfizer



Protective chemicals were found in about 9 out of 10 people 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of Pfizer.
Looking at different protective thresholds, protection was reduced to 7 out of 10 after 4 weeks and around half after 10-12 weeks.
For Moderna, almost all people had strong protection after 4 weeks.
People on dialysis who were vaccinated with Pfizer and got Moderna booster within the next 6 month had significant protection against the COVID-19 virus.
While the first two doses of Moderna or Pfizer vaccine gave adequate protection to some patients, the booster increased protection against the COVID-19 virus in almost all patients.
