Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

Rationale for review: Heterologous prime-boost doses of COVID-19 vaccines ('mix-and-match' approach) are being studied to test for the effectiveness of Oxford (AZD1222), Pfizer (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccines for COVID in 'Com-Cov2 trial' in UK, and that of Oxford and Pfizer vaccines in 'CombivacS trial' in Spain.
Later, other heterologous combinatios of CoronaVac (DB15806), Janssen (JNJ-78436735), CanSino (AD5-nCOV), and other were also being trialed to explore their effectiveness.
Previously, such a strategy was deployed for HIV, Ebola virus, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and hepatitis B to develop the artificial acquired active immunity.
The present review explores the science behind such an approach for candidate COVID-19 vaccines developed using eleven different platforms approved by the World Health Organization.
Key findings: The candidate vaccines' pharmaceutical parameters (e.g. platforms, number needed to vaccinate and intervals, adjuvanted status, excipients and preservatives added, efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine adverse events, and boosters), and clinical aspects must be analysed for the mix-and-match approach.
Heterologous prime-boost trials showed safety, effectiveness, higher systemic reactogenicity, well tolerability with improved immunogenicity, and flexibility profiles for future vaccinations, especially during acute and global shortages, compared to the homologous counterparts.
Conclusions/recommendations. Still, large controlled trials are warranted to address challenging variants of concerns including Omicron and other, and to generalize the effectiveness of the approach in regular as well as emergency use during vaccine scarcity.
