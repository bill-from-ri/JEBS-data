How does pacemaker work?

Pacemakers are adjustable artificial electrical pulse generators, frequently emitting a pulse with a duration between 0.5 and 25 milliseconds with an output of 0.1 to 15 volts, at a frequency up to 300 times per minute.
The cardiologist or pacemaker technologist will be able to interrogate and control the pacing rate, the pulse width, and the voltage, whether the device is temporary or permanent.
Pacemakers are typically categorized as external or internal.
The external variety is almost always placed for temporary stabilization of the patient or to facilitate some type of surgical procedure.
The implantable type is usually permanent and often, significantly more complex than the temporary, external variety.
Pacemakers are one type of cardiac implantable electronic devices (known as CIED).
This broad category also includes implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs).
Collectively, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the advent of the transistor.
As technology has improved, so has the pacemaker device.
The first implantable ICD was developed in 1980, and since that time, it has become more difficult to differentiate between pacemakers and ICDs.
This is because every ICD currently implanted has an anti-bradycardia pacing function.
It is critical for the patient and any health care provider to understand which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy.
This is most likely to occur with any electromagnetic interference (EMI) and could lead to activation of the device (if it is an ICD).
Most types of CIED use several insulated lead wires with non-insulated tips that are implanted in the heart, either by percutaneous vein insertion or directly by a cardiac surgeon.
Cardiac pacemakers are made up of two parts: the pulse generator and the leads or electrodes.
