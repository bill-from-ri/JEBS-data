How does pacemaker work?

A pacemaking system consists of a generator the produces pulses and lead or leads to carry the electrical impulse to the patient's heart.
Specific codes for pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator are made to describe the type of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator implanted in the patient.
The American College of Cardiologists (heart doctors) gave guidelines for connecting and fitting a pacemaker to regulate the heart rate and implanting a cardioverter defibrillator, a battery powered device placed under the skin that keeps track of the heart rate.
Certain pacemakers have magnet-operated switches; however, using a magnet can have serious negative effects. Therefore, devices should be considered programmable unless known otherwise.
When a patient who has a device undergoes any procedure (with or without anesthesia), special precautions have to be taken including a history of the patient's health and a physical exam, checking the pacemaker before and after the procedure to make sure its working, emergency drugs/temporary pacing and defibrillation, reprogramming of the pacemaker, and disabling certain pacemaker functions if required. Monitoring of problems with electrolytes and the metabolism and avoiding certain drugs and equipments that can interfere with pacemaker function are also reviewed.
If unexpected interactions between the pacemaker and other devices are found, consider stopping the procedure until the source of interference can be eliminated or managed. All other measures should be taken to ensure proper pacemaker function.
After the procedure, the heart rate and rhythm should be monitored continuously, and emergency drugs and equipment should be ready, if needed. Also, discussing with a heart specialist or a service that focuses on pacemaker-implantable cardioverter defibrillators may be necessary.
