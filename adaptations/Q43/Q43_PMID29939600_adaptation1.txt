How does pacemaker work?

Pacemakers are electronic devices that stimulate the heart with electrical impulses to maintain or restore a normal heartbeat.
In 1952, a physician named Zoll described an effective way of supporting patients with internal heart pacemaker activity and/or sending pulses through tissue by an artificial, electric, external pacemaker device.
The pacing of the heart was accomplished by electrodes placed under the skin but could be maintained only for a short period.
In 1957, complete heart block was treated using electrodes directly attached to the heart.
These early observations started the idea that cardiac electrical failure (in which the heart cannot maintain a normal heart rate) can be controlled.
It ultimately led to the development of the totally implantable (permanently under the skin) pacemaker by Chardack, Gage, and Greatbatch.
Since then, there have been several advancements in pacemakers, and the modern-day permanent pacemaker is placed under the skin.
There are 3 types of artificial pacemakers: Implantable pulse generators;  External, miniaturized, patient portable, battery-powered, pulse generators to temporarily control heart rates; Console battery or AC-powered devices or monitors with high-current external pads placed on top of the skin, or low-current inside the body for temporary pacing in uncoordinated contracting of the heart or at infrequent times.
All heart pacemakers consist of 2 components: a pulse generator which provides the electrical impulse for stimulation on the heart muscle and 1 or more electrodes or leads which deliver the electrical impulse from the generator to the heart muscle.
