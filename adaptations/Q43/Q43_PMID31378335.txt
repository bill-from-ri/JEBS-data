How does pacemaker work?

Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) provide lifesaving therapy for the treatment of bradyarrhythmias, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and advanced systolic heart failure.
All pacemakers have 2 basic functions: (1) to pace and (2) to sense intrinsic electrical activity of the heart.
Most pacemakers are programmed to inhibit pacing when they sense native electrical activity and only pace in the absence of intrinsic electrical activity.
More specifically, pacemakers can be programmed to set which chamber or chambers will pace, which chamber or chambers will sense intrinsic electrical activity, how the pacemaker will respond to sensed electrical activity (ie, inhibit pacing), and if rate-adaptive pacing will be used.
