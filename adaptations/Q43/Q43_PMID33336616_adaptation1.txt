How does pacemaker work?

The process of stimulating the heart grew from life-saving devices that prevent asystole (when the activity in the heart stops or "flatline") to the treatment of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure.
Cardiac stimulation nowadays aims to correct the physical root cause of heart problems in different heart diseases.
Doctors' experiences have led to an awareness of the hidden risks of standard pacing methods to get the heart beat back to normal that can lead to unexpected heart problems.
New pacing methods have come about, leading to a new idea of what truly represents 'physiologic pacing' beyond making sure the two parts of the heart beat in a good rhythm.
This article analyzes new evidence that supports the available methods to create a setting in bradycardia (slow heart beat) pacing that is tailored for the individual. The article also discusses future developments.
The expert opinion is that 'physiologic stimulation' methods should develop to allow effective and far-reaching use.
In one way, new guiding catheters (flexible tubes), the use of specific tests to check the heart's electrical system, and implanting devices using imaging tools are needed to make pacing successful and effective in the long term, but leads to a shorter procedure time. In the other way, stimulation without using wires needs to upgrade to a better physical setting to mimic customary DDD (dual-chamber antibradycardia that can stimulate the chambers of the heart) pacing and possibly His-Purkinje pacing, the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles (lower heart chambers).
