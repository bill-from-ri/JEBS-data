How does pacemaker work?

This article provides an overview of current heart device management, complications, and future areas for development.
The last 70 years have seen huge advances in the field of implantable cardiac devices, from tools to diagnose conditions to electrical therapies to address slower heart rates, ventricular arrhythmia that causes irregular heart beats that don't send enough blood to the body, and cardiac resynchronisation to help the heart beat at the right rhythm.
While out-of-hours specialist cardiology cover and regional (localized) arrhythmia pathways are increasingly established, they are not universal, and the management of arrhythmia remains an important part of clinical medicine for the general physician.
This article discusses recommendations on diagnosing heart rhythms, pacing for bradycardia (slower than normal heart beat), cardiac resynchronization and implantable cardioverter defibrillator devices to treat fast heart beats, along with common complications.
Finally, future developments such as the potential of portable devices to help with diagnosing problems, enclosing cardiac devices in a mesh covering that has antibiotic (bacteria-fighting) medicines, and the increasing use of pacemakers that do not include any wires are described.
