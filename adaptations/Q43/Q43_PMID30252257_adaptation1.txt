How does pacemaker work?

Pacemakers are devices that generate artificial electrical pulses.
A heart specialist or pacemaker technologist will be able to control the pacing rate and other functions, whether the device is temporary or permanent.
Pacemakers are typically categorized as external (main device is outside the body) or internal (device is implanted in the body).
The external variety is almost always placed to temporarily stabilize the patient or to assist some type of surgical procedure.
The implantable type is usually permanent and often much more complex than the temporary, external variety.
Pacemakers are one type of a cardiac implantable electronic device (known as CIED).
This broad category also includes implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which are devices designed to directly treat a slow heart rate.
Collectively, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the creation of the transistor that can record electrical activity inside heart cells.
As technology has improved, so has the pacemaker device.
The first implantable ICD was developed in 1980, and since that time, it has become more difficult to tell the difference between pacemakers and ICDs.
This is because every ICD currently implanted has an anti-bradycardia (anti-slow-heart-rate) pacing function.
It is critical for the patient and any health care provider to understand which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy.
This is most likely to occur with interference by another electrical device and could lead to activation of the device (if it is an ICD).
Most types of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) use several insulated lead wires with non-insulated tips that are implanted in the heart, either by inserting a catheter into a vein or directly by a heart surgeon.
Pacemakers in the heart are made up of two parts: the pulse generator and the leads or electrodes.
