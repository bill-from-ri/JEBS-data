How to treat phda1?

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism.
Structural brain abnormalities are common in PDCD.
A case of a patient with PDCD with an unusual presentation is described.
A 20-month-old boy with hypotonia and developmental delay, presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis.
During hospitalisation, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds.
Two days after starting these feeds, he developed respiratory arrest requiring intubation.
His blood gas before arrest revealed lactate of 8.9 mmol/L despite normal haemodynamics.
After stabilisation and a period of compulsory fasting, subsequent feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis.
A metabolic workup revealed an elevated serum pyruvate level.
Brain MRI was normal.
Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed PDCD.
The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in the X-linked PDHA1 gene.
The severity of PDCD can range from neonatal death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in our index case.
Normal brain MRI is reported in only 2% of patients with PDCD.
There is no effective treatment for PDCD.
In patients with proximal muscle weakness and feeding intolerance with glucose-containing feeds, the presence of lactic acidosis should raise the suspicion of PDCD irrespective of the patient's age and normal MRI.
