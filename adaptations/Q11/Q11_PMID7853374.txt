How to treat phda1?

Treatment of PDH deficiency rarely influences the course of the disease.
It is usually possible to reverse or minimize systemic lactic acid accumulation by giving a high fat/low carbohydrate "ketogenic" diet, but this does not alleviate the neurological symptoms as structural damage in the brain is present from before birth and many patients do not have significant metabolic problems.
There is some evidence that dichloroacetate (which inhibits the specific PDH kinase and thereby activates any residual functioning complex) will also reduce the metabolic disturbance in some patients, but, again, this is rarely accompanied by any objective improvement in neurological performance.
A more favorable outcome can be expected in the extremely rare patients with a thiamine responsive form of the disease and, for this reason, a short therapeutic trial of thiamine is worth trying in all cases.
