How to treat phda1?

Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency or shortage is a rare disorder caused by genetic changes, and its progression can rarely be stopped by treatment.
It is usually possible to reverse or minimize some symptoms by giving a high fat/low carbohydrate "ketogenic" diet, but this does not help with delays in mental and motor development because damage in the brain is present before birth.
A chemical in the body called dichloroacetate may also reduce the disturbance on metabolism in some patients, but, again, this is rarely accompanied by any improvement in mental and motor development.
In rare cases, a vitamin called thiamine may respond to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and so a short course of thiamine is worth trying for all cases.
