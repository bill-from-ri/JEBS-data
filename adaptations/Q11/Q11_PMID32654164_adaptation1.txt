How to treat phda1?

Metabolic epilepsies (seizures) arise in the context of rare hereditary or inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and can be caused in rare disorders.
A common feature of these disorders is they cause brain-related symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay (delays in reaching language, thinking, social, or motor skills), and movement disorders.
The ketogenic diet, a low-carb/high-fat diet, has been successfully used to treat such conditions.
How a ketogenic diet exactly impacts inborn errors of metabolism is not known, but it is likely that they influence the negative impacts of genetic mutations.
Benefits of a ketogenic diet are broadly grouped into restoration of parts of metabolism that are impaired, improved maintenance of cells and cells processes, reduced pain and swelling, and processes that control gene activity without changing the DNA.
It is possible that a ketogenic diet may be useful in other disorders of metabolism that include epileptic seizures.
At the same time, there are some disorders where ketogenic diets should be avoided.
More research is needed to better describe metabolic epilepsies that would benefit from a ketogenic diet.
Expanding knowledge will be important to design metabolism-based treatments.
