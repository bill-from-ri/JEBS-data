How to treat phda1?

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency or shortage is a rare disorder that can impact metabolism and lead to problems in the nervous sytem. The objective of this study is to describe cases of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency after starting a ketogenic (low carb/high fat) diet and to review other studies that have images of the brain in patients with the disorder.
Medical information from 3 cases of patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who had magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs), or scans of the brain, taken before and after they started a ketogenic diet are reported.
Researchers searched for other published cases of patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who also had multiple MRIs.
The 3 cases in this report showed improvement by being on a ketogenic diet.
Two cases showed a reversal of some brain lesions or damage on repeat MRI after starting a ketogenic diet.
The study's search for other cases found 13 patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who had some form of treatment, and of this group 4 patients had repeat MRIs that showed definite improvement.
In all cases, improvement occurred in lesions in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that helps coordinate movement.
In patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, basal ganglia lesions on MRI are reversible with treatment in some cases and could serve as a way to measure how a patient responds to treatment.
