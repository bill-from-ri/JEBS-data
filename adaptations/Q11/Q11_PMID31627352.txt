How to treat phda1?

Diets low in carbohydrates and proteins and enriched in fat stimulate the hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies (KB).
These molecules are used as alternative fuel for energy production in target tissues.
The synthesis and utilization of KB are tightly regulated both at transcriptional and hormonal levels.
The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), currently recognized as one of the master regulators of ketogenesis, integrates nutritional signals to the activation of transcriptional networks regulating fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis.
New factors, such as circadian rhythms and paracrine signals, are emerging as important aspects of this metabolic regulation.
However, KB are currently considered not only as energy substrates but also as signaling molecules.
β-hydroxybutyrate has been identified as class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, thus establishing a connection between products of hepatic lipid metabolism and epigenetics.
Ketogenic diets (KD) are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy, also caused by genetic defects such as Glut1 and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Syndromes.
However, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use KD in other diseases, such as cancer, neurological and metabolic disorders.
Nonetheless, clear-cut evidence of the efficacy of KD in other disorders remains to be provided in order to suggest the adoption of such diets to metabolic-related pathologies.
