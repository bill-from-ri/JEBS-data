Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which is when the parathyroid glands become hyperactive due to a disease outside the glands, can be an effect of long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Vitamin D metabolism is altered since early CKD. Vitamin D loss is a known trigger of SHPT.
While untreated SHPT may worsen to uncontrolled, excess parathyroid hormone production with harmful effects in advanced CKD, best treatments for preventing this worsening are unknown.
The idea of using vitamin D target site or receptor activators (VDRA) in working kidney patients, has been weakened by the risk of bone breakdown and calcium-phosphate imbalance.
Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-choice therapy for SHPT and low active vitamin D levels.
Still, no high-quality evidence supports the best choice among different vitamin D medications.
The review explores available data on the safety and success of nutritional vitamin D, VDRA, and nutritional therapy in replenishing active vitamin D shortage and treating SHPT in working kidney CKD patients.
Best treatment for low active vitamin D and SHPT is unknown, due to a partial grasp of the best self-regulating mechanism of mineral metabolism to CKD progression.
Nutritional vitamin D and therapy appear safest treatments, when considering single-patient characteristics.
VDRA should be limited to uncontrolled SHPT by first-choice therapy.
