Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide.
Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and care by primary care (family) doctors are necessary to prevent negative outcomes associated with CKD, including heart disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.
Defined as an ongoing impairment in kidney structure or function for more than 3 months, chronic kidney disease affects 8% to 16% of people worldwide.
In developed countries, CKD is most commonly associated with diabetes and high blood pressure.
However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report knowing about of their disease.
Among people diagnosed as having CKD, new risk assessment tools can help guide treatment, monitoring, and inform when to send patients to a specialist. These new tools include using the glomerular filtration rate, a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working, and albuminuria, which is too much albumin (a blood protein) in the urine.
The best management of CKD includes reducing risk of heart disease, treating albuminuria, avoiding medications that are toxic to the kidneys, and changes to drug dosing, such as antibiotics.
Patients also need monitoring for complications with CKD, such as higher than normal potassium levels, too much acid in the fluids of the body, too much phosphorus in the blood, low vitamin D, overactive glands in the neck that produce parathyroid (calcium-regulating) hormone, and anemia (low red blood cells).
Those at high risk of chronic kidney disease progression based on tests that check how well the kidneys are working or too much albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is called albuminuria, should be quickly sent to a kidney specialist.
Diagnosis, determining the stage, and appropriate referral of chronic kidney disease by primary care doctors are important in reducing the negative impact of chronic kidney disease worldwide.
