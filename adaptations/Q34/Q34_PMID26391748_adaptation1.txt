Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

A group of internal medicine and kidney doctors developed a practical approach to guide the assessment (diagnosis) and care of chronic kidney disease by primary care doctors.
Chronic kidney disease is defined by using a glomerular filtration rate, a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working, and/or other measurements or conditions that are a sign of kidney damage for at least 3 months.
The most common tests for chronic kidney disease include the glomerular filtration rate that is estimated from the amount of creatinine (a waste product from the normal wear and tear on muscles) in the blood and too much albumin (a blood protein) in the urine which is called albuminuria.
These tests for creatinine levels and albumin proteins should be done for people with diabetes and/or high blood pressure but are not recommended for the general population.
Managing chronic kidney disease includes reducing the patient's risk of the disease getting worse and risk of related complications, such as acute or immediate kidney injury or heart disease.
To prevent chronic kidney disease from worsening, managing blood pressure, using medications to treat high albumin levels and high blood pressure, measuring hemoglobin levels (red blood cells) for patients with diabetes, and correcting when there is too much acid in the body's fluids is needed.
To reduce the negative effect of medications on patients, the level of creatinine should be noted when prescribing drugs, and nephrotoxins which can damage the kidneys should be avoided.
The main reasons to send a patient to a kidney specialist are based on creatinine levels, severe albuminuria (too much protein in urine), and acute kidney injury (a sudden episode of kidney failure).
The main goal of managing chronic kidney disease is to prevent the disease from getting worse, to minimize complications, and to promote quality of life.
