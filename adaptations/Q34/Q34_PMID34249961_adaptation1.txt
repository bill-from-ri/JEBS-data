Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Due to the unique role of the kidney in turning nutrients into fuel, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) lose the ability to release dissolved substances and to maintain a healthy internal balance of water, sodium, and other elements in the body.
Changing the nutrients that are consumed and checking for how nutrients impact health in this population is important, since it can impact health results, including advancing to kidney failure, quality of life, illness, and death.
Although there are other factors involved in the progression and the likely course of chronic kidney disease, nutritional steps are a main part of the care of patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, a process of filtering the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally by using a machine.
This review discusses how diet in adults with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 who are not on dialysis can have a protective effect on kidneys, including transplant patients.
