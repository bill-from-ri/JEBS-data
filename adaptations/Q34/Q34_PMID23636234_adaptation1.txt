Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Protein-energy wasting is a decline in the amount of protein in the body and leads to less stored energy. It is a condition present in early to moderate stages of chronic kidney disease and a signal that negative health outcomes may occur.
Protein-energy wasting often increases as chronic kidney disease gets worse, in part because of more inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) combined with too much breakdown of proteins and loss of appetite.
This leads to not enough proteins and energy, which may be held up by dietary restrictions from doctors and not enough monitoring of how the patient's nutrition impacts their health.
Worsening uremia, which is when there is too much waste in the blood, may make uncontrolled diets have a negative impact on chronic disease patients.
Too many waste products in the blood that would normally be removed by urine can have harmful effects, including an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in the body (which can lead to cell and tissue damage), endothelial dysfunction which is damaged functioning of the lining of blood vessels impacting the heart, and other conditions.
Nutritional interventions (changing diet and diet behavior to reach a health goal) in chronic kidney disease, when combined with other therapies unrelated to nutrition, create a number of strategies aimed at improving the internal systems of the body in the patient and the patient's health outcomes.
How nutritional interventions can work and their effects on patients with chronic kidney disease with protein-energy wasting is not well studied.
This article reviews the definitions and the process of protein-energy wasting in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, and examines when changes in the diet is appropriate and areas that need further research.
