How long is covid 19 communicable?

Defining the period of time someone can spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, to others can positively impact public health and prevent infection spreading within healthcare facilities. COVID-19 is a harmful, breathing-related, viral disease.
Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required two negative (or undetected) COVID-19 tests before COVID-19 infected patients could come out of quarantine (isolation).
However, several COVID-19 patients continually test positive (with COVID-19 detected) after clinically recovering from the virus. Based on several reports, this is not believed to be the norm for the replication-competent virus, or a virus that is able to reproduce itself in one person and infect other people.
The virus appears to be contagious (easily spread) around the time symptoms first appear. The ability of the virus to spread decreases as symptoms progress. The ability of the virus to spread becomes near-zero around 10 days in mild to moderately ill patients. The ability of the virus to spread becomes near-zero around 15 days in severely to critically ill and immunocompromised (those with decreased immune system function) patients.
The longest documented duration between symptom onset and viral spread is 20 days.
This review summarizes the most recent evidence on the length of time COVID-19 is able to spread from one patient to another. Additionally, this paper states how this knowledge has helped create improved COVID-19 mandates or rules on quarantine lengths.
