How long is covid 19 communicable?

Defining the duration of infectvity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a viral breathing-related illness, can influence public health and infection control practice for healthcare.
Early in the pandemic, most hospitals needed 2 test results detecting no disease before releasing patients with Covid-19, or SARS-CoV-2.
Many patients still have test results detecting the disease for weeks to months after recovery. Studies note that these results generally do not reflect contagious viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 seems the most contagious around the time of symptom onset. The infectivity or ability to spread the virus quickly decreases to near-zero after about 10 days in mildly ill patients and 15 days in severely ill and immunocompromised patients.
The longest interval for contagious viruses so far is 20 days from symptom onset.
This review summarizes current evidence on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this affects new public health recommendation for releasing people in isolation.
