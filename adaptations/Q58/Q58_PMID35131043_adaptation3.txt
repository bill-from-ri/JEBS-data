How often can i get a covid-19 vaccine?

The effectiveness of a vaccine against COVID-19 6 months after vaccination is not fully understood.
We studied the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden.
We took our data from Swedish nationwide registers.
The data were from all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccines, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021.
Two outcomes were evaluated.
The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021.
The second was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or death from any cause 30 days after confirmed infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021.
Between Dec 28, 2020, and Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses). We compared these individuals to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals. The total number of people studied was 1,685,948.
In patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 dropped progressively over time, from 92% at 15-30 days after vaccination, to 47% at 121-180 days, and to 23% from day 211 onwards.
Reduced vaccine effectiveness was slightly slower for the mRNA-1273 vaccine, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% at 15-30 days and 59% from day 181 onwards.
Reduction of vaccine effectiveness was also slightly slower for the combination of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine effectiveness was 89% at 15-30 days and 66% from day 121 onwards.
By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine only (not combined with another vaccine) was 68% at 15-30 days, with no detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards.
In patients who had severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness dropped from 89% at 15-30 days to 64% from day 121 onwards.
Overall, there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and in older individuals than in younger individuals.
We found progressively reduced vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity across all subgroups of patients, but the rate of reduction differed according to vaccine type.
In patients who had severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness seemed to be better maintained, although some reduction became evident after 4 months.
Our study provides evidence that a third vaccine dose as a booster will improve immunity against COVID-19.
