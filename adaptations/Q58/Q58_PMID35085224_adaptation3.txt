How often can i get a covid-19 vaccine?

It is estimated that the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has declined in recent months. There are several possible reasons for this. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time. New strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can become resistant to the vaccine, a process called immune evasion. A combination of these two phenomena or other factors could also cause decreased vaccine effectiveness.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all people 12 years and older receive a third booster shot of an mRNA vaccine 5 months or later after receiving the second primary shot. Patients with a weakened immune system should receive a third primary shot.
A third dose of the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine) increases the blood level of antibodies that neutralize the virus and prevent infection. Three recent studies from Israel have shown that a third booster dose helps prevent COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant (SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2).
However, in the United States there is little data to prove the effectiveness of third booster shots to prevent COVID-19, especially since the Omicron variant (SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529) became the most common strain in mid-December 2021.
From August 26, 2021 to January 5, 2022, the VISION Network examined vaccine effectiveness among adults 18 and older across 10 states in the US by studying over 222,000 patients in 383 emergency departments and urgent care clinics, and over 87,000 hospitalized inpatients from 259 hospitals.
The analysis was split apart at each study site by looking at the periods before and after the Omicron strain became the most common strain.
During the time when the Delta strain was most common in the US (August to mid-December 2021), in emergency departments and urgent care clinics vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was 86% effective 14-179 days after dose 2, dropped to 76% more than 180 days after dose 2, but increased up to 94% 14 days or more after dose 3.
When the Omicron strain was most common, vaccine effectiveness for the same time intervals was only 52%, 38%, and 82%, respectively.
In hospitalized patients, during the Delta strain period vaccine effectiveness was 90% 14-179 days after dose 2, 81% 180 days or longer after dose 2, and 94% 14 days or more after dose 3.
During the Omicron period, estimates for the same time intervals after vaccination were 81%, 57%, and 90%, respectively.
The highest estimates of vaccine effectiveness in both patient populations during both the Delta and Omicron periods were in adults who had received a third dose of mRNA vaccine.
Based on this data, we recommed that all unvaccinated persons should get vaccinated as soon as possible.
All adults who have received their first two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines should receive a third dose as soon as they are eligible, and eligible persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters.
