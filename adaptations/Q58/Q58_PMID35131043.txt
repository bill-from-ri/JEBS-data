How often can i get a covid-19 vaccine?

Background: Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 beyond 6 months remains incompletely understood.
We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden.
Methods: This retrospective, total population cohort study was done using data from Swedish nationwide registers.
The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021.
Two outcomes were evaluated.
The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021.
The second was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or all-cause 30-day mortality after confirmed infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021.
Findings: Between Dec 28, 2020, and Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses), and were matched (1:1) to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals (total study cohort n=1 685 948).
For the outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned progressively over time, from 92% (95% CI 92 to 93; p<0Â·001) at 15-30 days, to 47% (39 to 55; p<0Â·001) at 121-180 days, and to 23% (-2 to 41; p=0Â·07) from day 211 onwards.
Waning was slightly slower for mRNA-1273, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% (94 to 97; p<0Â·001) at 15-30 days and 59% (18 to 79; p=0Â·012) from day 181 onwards.
Waning was also slightly slower for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine effectiveness was 89% (79 to 94; p<0Â·001) at 15-30 days and 66% (41 to 80; p<0Â·001) from day 121 onwards.
By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 68% (52 to 79; p<0Â·001) at 15-30 days, with no detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards (-19% [-98 to 28]; p=0Â·49).
For the outcome of severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness waned from 89% (82 to 93; p<0Â·001) at 15-30 days to 64% (44 to 77; p<0Â·001) from day 121 onwards.
Overall, there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and in older individuals than in younger individuals.
Interpretation: We found progressively waning vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity across all subgroups, but the rate of waning differed according to vaccine type.
With respect to severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness seemed to be better maintained, although some waning became evident after 4 months.
The results strengthen the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster.
