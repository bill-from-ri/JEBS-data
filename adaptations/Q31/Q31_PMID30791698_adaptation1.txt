What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics.
We try to suggest ways to treat tardive dyskinesia.
Preventing tardive dyskinesia is very important, and doctors should prescribe antipsychotics as recommended, including only prescribing them for certain conditions, using the lowest working dose, and limiting how long patients take them.
The first recommended treatment of tardive dyskinesia is to have the patient stop taking antipsychotics if possible.
Stopping antipsychotics is not possible for many patients with serious mental illness due to the disease returning.
Switching from a first-generation (older) to a second-generation (newer) antipsychotic, such as clozapine or quetiapine, may help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms.
Studies show tests with new vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, to be the best additional treatment for tardive dyskinesia.
Canada has not approved these drugs for use.
We conclude that information on tardive dyskinesia treatment is limited, and preventing TD is the best way to manage it.
More studies that look at safety and how well deutetrabenazine and valbenazine work are needed, and it is uncertain how reliably available these drugs are to patients outside of the United States.
