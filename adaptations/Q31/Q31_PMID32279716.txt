What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an iatrogenic condition that encompasses a wide phenomenological spectrum of movement disorders caused by exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs).
TD may cause troublesome or disabling symptoms that impair quality of life.
Due to frequent, often inappropriate, use of DRBAs, TD prevalence rates among patients exposed to DRBAs continue to be high.
The judicious use of DRBAs is key to the prevention of TD, reduction of disease burden, and achieving lasting remission.
Dopamine-depleting vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors are considered the treatment of choice of TD.
