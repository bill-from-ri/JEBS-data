What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD), characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics, negatively affects functioning and quality of life for patients.
Although many believed it would be different, TD has not gone away even with the use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), which are less likely to cause movement side effects.
Instead, changes in how antipsychotics are prescribed and antipsychotics prescribed for unapproved use have increased the patients at risk of TD.
We describe treatment options for TD as part of an individual-specific plan, including changing antipsychotic dosing and treating dyskinesia.
