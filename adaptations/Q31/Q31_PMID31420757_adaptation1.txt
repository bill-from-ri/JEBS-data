What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Taking medications, mainly antipsychotics, that reduce activity of dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward) causes tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a movement disorder.
TD often causes physical and emotional pain or suffering and affects the quality of life of patients.
We rated scientific studies to summarize the latest advancements in the area of TD.
We found that FDA approved vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, in 2017.
These drugs work in several clinical trials.
Best practice guidelines for doctors for treating tardive dyskinesia have also been updated.
Different drugs are being used to treat TD with VMAT2 inhibitors to be the first drug approved by the FDA.
Drugs used to treat TD should be specific to the individual patient.
Long-term studies will determine how best to treat patients, especially in the real world.
As doctors, we need to consider all symptoms, causes, and possible drug side effects to find the best possible "match" for our patients.
