What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disorder of involuntary movements, typlically of the lower face muscles, limbs, and other muscle groups.
The condition is linked to exposure with blocking agents, like antipsychotics used to treat mental illnesses, of the chemical messenger dopamine.
Since the allowed and off-label uses for these agents has increased over the last 20 years, more patients are receiving antipsychotics than before.
While patients treated with one class of antipsychotics may have less risk for developing TD than those treated with another class, the decreased risk is not as big as expected.
Also, patients with long-lasting mental illnesses often need long-term use of antipsychotics, pytting them at risk for TD.
This article describes the widespreadness of TD, its risk factors, its prevention, its identification strategies like medical criteria and ratings, and evidence for its treatments, including deutetrabenazine and valbenzaine used for treating movement disorders.
