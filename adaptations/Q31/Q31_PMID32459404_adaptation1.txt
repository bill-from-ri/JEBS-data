What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

We aim to understand how well different drugs work to treat tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a movement disorder.
On December 12, 2017, we searched for published scientific studies looking at the treatment of TD versus sugar pills.
We included studies if they looked at treatment of TD as the main result and randomly assigned participants to groups receiving TD treatment or sugar pills.

We used statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies.
Results favored vitamin E over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction.
The results of the published vitamin E studies were different from results of unpublished studies.
Taking vitamin E for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater TD symptom reduction.
Results favored vitamin B6 over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction.
Results favored vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction.
Results favored amantadine - a dopamine promoter - over sugar pills.
Results did not favor calcium channel blockers, which block transport of calcium in the body, over sugar pills.
We conclude that many studies show that VMAT2 inhibitors, vitamin E, vitamin Bâ‚†, and amantadine may work to treat TD.
Because results of the published vitamin E studies were different from results of unpublished studies and taking vitamin E for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater TD symptom reduction, the benefits of vitamin E in TD might not be as great as studies suggest.
Studies comparing TD treatments to each other are needed to compare how well they work and how cost-effective they are.
