What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a condition that includes a wide range of uncontrollable movement disorders caused by taking antipsychotics.
TD may cause physical and emotional pain or suffering that negatively affects quality of life.
The total number of TD cases in patients who have taken antipsychotics at a given time continues to be high due to frequent, often unnecessary, antipsychotic use.
Sensible use of antipsychotics is needed to prevent, reduce disability and death associated with, and end TD for good.
Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), are the best treatment for TD.
