Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Researchers studied whether the signs and symptoms associated with chronic cough were helpful in finding out the disease that caused it.
Patients with chronic cough were studied by a specific set of rules in order to make a diagnosis.
The signs and symptoms of chronic cough caused by a single disease were compared. These patients were divided into 4 groups: cough-variant asthma (CVA), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), post-nasal drip syndrome (PNDS), eosinophilic bronchitis (EB), and  gastroesophageal reflux related cough (GERC).
A total 196 patients met the rules: 55 had EB, 45 had UACS, 50 had CVA, and 46 had GERC.
No important difference was found in age, gender, and course of disease among EB, UACS, CVA, and GERC.
Nighttime cough (nocturnal cough) occurred much more often in CVA than in EB, UACS, and GERC.
Nocturnal cough was very highly associated with CVA.
Cough associated with meals and backflow of stomach contents was more highly associated with GERC than the other groups.
UACS was more associated with postnasal drip, symptoms of nose inflammation , and history of nose diseases.
The signs and symptoms of chronic cough are useful in the diagnosis of a single underlying cause.
