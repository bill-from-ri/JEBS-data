Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Researchers studied the causes of chronic cough in Chinese patients.
This study included 86 patients with chronic cough.
The rules for finding the cause of chronic cough included a test to study cells in sputum, as well as other tests.
Researchers also studied how well treatments worked according to the cause (diagnosis).
The diagnosis was made in about 90% of the patients.
The most common causes included: cough variant asthma (CVA), postnasal drip syndrome (PND), eosinophilic bronchitis (inflammation of airways-EB), and gastroesophageal relux (GER).
Cough improved in about 94% of patients after treatment based on the cause.
Besides CVA, PNDs, and GER, eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) is also an important cause of chronic cough.
A good response to treatment based on the cause is very important to making the correct diagnosis.
