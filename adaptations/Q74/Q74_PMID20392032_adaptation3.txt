Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Researchers studied ways to treat patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms due to disorder of a nerve supplying sensation (sensory neuropathy) to the throat-the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Researchers studied patients who had symptoms of sensory neuropathy including disorders of speech (dysphonia), spasms of the muscles of the voice box (laryngospasm), and chronic cough.
The patients were followed to see if their symptoms improved after starting a neuromodulator (a drug that has an effect on nerves). 
Patients were asked if the drug improved their symptoms.
In 12 patients, tests showed 75% had motor neuropathy (disorder of the nerves controlling the muscles) of the throat.  Also, 83% had chronic cough treated with a neuromodulator. They were followed for about 20 months.
Two neuromodulator drugs were used in the study, amitriptyline hydrochloride (about 25 mg a day) and gabapentin (about 300 mg three times a day).
It took about 2 months for complete symptom improvement after the drugs were first started.
These neuromodulator drugs often help the symptoms if doctors suspect neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as the cause.
In patients with chronic cough and recurrent laryngospasm, doctors may add therapy to prevent reflux and decrease stoamch acid.
Patient who have motor neuropathy seem to have better improvement with neuromodulator drugs.
