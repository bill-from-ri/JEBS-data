This study reports on how often and how severe symptoms of the throat and voice box occur in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to those without COPD (controls). 
A total of 27 patients with COPD and 13 controls were included, comparing their age and gender.
Facts about the patients and controls include age, gender, history of smoking, and history of allergic rhinitis (irritation of the nose due to allergies).
The severity of reflux symptoms was given a score (Reflux Symptom Index).
The Reflux Symptom Index and how often each of the throat and voice box (laryngopharyngeal) symptoms occurred was scored.
The average age of patients was 61 years.
Ninety-two percent of the patients were smokers . About 11% had allergic rhinitis.
The average of Total Reflux Symptom Index in patients was significantly higher compared to controls.
In the COPD group, 18 patients had a positive Reflux symptom index compared to one in the control group.
There was also a significant difference between the average of 6 laryngopharyngeal symptoms in patients compared to controls.
COPD patients had higher amounts of hoarseness, throat-clearing, excesss throat mucus, cough and sticking sensation in the throat.
Laryngopharygeal reflux (LPR) is a disorder caused by the backflow of stomach contents into the throat. It is more common in patients compared to controls. LPR occurs a lot more often and it is more severe in COPD patients.
