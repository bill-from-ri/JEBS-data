Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Chronic throat clearing or a feeling of 'something' at the back of the throat (or nose) is a common cause for referral to ear, nose, and throat dostors.
Treatment of the problem causing these symptoms may help. But in many cases the cause is not found.
Currently, there is no accepted treatment which is effective against these symptoms.
Researchers studied a plan of sipping ice cold sparkling, fizzy (carbonated) water to help stop the cycle of throat-clearing.
A questionnaire was mailed to 72 patients that had been told to use this plan.
Improvement was seen in the severity of the symptoms in 63% of these patients
The greatest improvement was seen in patients who had the worse symptoms and who had them most often.
Doctors advise that sipping ice cold carbonated water can help to break the cycle of throat-clearing.
