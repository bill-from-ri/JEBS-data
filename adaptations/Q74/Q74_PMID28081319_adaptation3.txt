Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Researchers studied the signs, symptoms and underlying causes of chronic cough (CC).
There were 510 patients that took part in the study.
The features in patients with different causes of chronic cough (CC) were compared. The different causes were gastroesophageal reflux cough (GERC), cough-variant asthma (CVA), and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS).
In the 510 patients, 404 had CC caused by a single disorder. In these patients, CC was caused by GERC in 175 patients, by CVA in 134 patients, and by UACS in 95 patients.
GERC patients have stomach acid backflow symptoms such as sour-tasting backflow, heartburn, inflammation of food tube (esophagus) on examination with an instrument (endoscopy), cough when the throat is touched, throat-clearing, daytime cough, and feelings of heaviness and pain in the chest.
CVA patients are sensitive to smog and other irritants. They coughed mostly at night and they reacted to drugs that cause the airways to open or close up.
UACS patients have a history and symptoms of inflammation of the nose, postnasal drip in the back of the throat, and wet coughing mostly during the daytime.
The facts allowed doctors to correctly diagnose the cause more than 70% of the time.
The most common causes of CC include GERC, CVA, and UACS. Doctors can diagnose which of these underlying  diseases cause CC by their signs and symptoms.
