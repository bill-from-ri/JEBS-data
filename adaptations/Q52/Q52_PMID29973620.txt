What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

Turner Syndrome (TS) is a condition where several genes are affected but the molecular mechanism remains unknown.
Identifying the genes that regulate the TS network is one of the main challenges in understanding its aetiology.
Here, we studied the regulatory network from manually curated genes reported in the literature and identified essential proteins involved in TS.
The power-law distribution analysis showed that TS network carries scale-free hierarchical fractal attributes.
This organization of the network maintained the self-ruled constitution of nodes at various levels without having centrality-lethality control systems.
Out of twenty-seven genes culminating into leading hubs in the network, we identified two key regulators (KRs) i.e. KDM6A and BDNF.
These KRs serve as the backbone for all the network activities.
Removal of KRs does not cause its breakdown, rather a change in the topological properties was observed.
Since essential proteins are evolutionarily conserved, the orthologs of selected interacting proteins in C. elegans, cat and macaque monkey (lower to higher level organisms) were identified.
We deciphered three important interologs i.e. KDM6A-WDR5, KDM6A-ASH2L and WDR5-ASH2L that form a triangular motif.
In conclusion, these KRs and identified interologs are expected to regulate the TS network signifying their biological importance.
