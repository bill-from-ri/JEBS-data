What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

Turner Syndrome (TS) is a genetic condition found in 1 out of every 2500 newborn girls. Turner syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormal amount of chromosomes (genetic material).
Prompt and effective diagnosis is very important to appropriately monitor the comorbidities (two or more diseases in one patient).
The aim of the study was to propose a feasible and practical diagnostic tool for newborn screening. The screening would be completed by quantifying (measuring) the dosage of specific genes in individuals with a diagnosis of complete X monosomy and TS variants. The gene doses would be compared to controls without chromosomal abnormalities. Monosomy indicates there is an absence of one member of a chromosome pair; instead of 46 chromosomes in each cell of the body, there is 45.
Study results showed the most useful indicators for these chromosomal variants were the genes found in the pseudoautosomic regions 1 and 2 (PAR1 and PAR2).
The authors concluded that these markers are useful for early detection in chromosomal imbalances, specifically those involving sex chromosomes.
