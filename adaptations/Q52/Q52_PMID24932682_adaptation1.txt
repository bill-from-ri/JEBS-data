What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

Turner syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality. The disease is characterized by the absence of the whole or part of the X chromosome in females.
This X aneuploidy condition, or condition of having abnormal number of chromosomes, is associated with a diverse set of clinical phenotypes. These phenotypes, or outward characteristics, include ovary dysfunction, short stature, brittle bones, and Type II diabetes mellitus.
These phenotypes differ in their severity and penetrance (extent) among those with the syndrome.
Haploinsufficiency, or when one copy of a gene is deleted, for a few X linked genes has been associated with some of these disease phenotypes.
RNA (special genetic material to create proteins) quantification can provide valuable insights to understand how these diseases form.
This study analyzed RNA profiles of human 45,X (abnormal) and 46,XX (normal) cells. This study identified differential (unique function) expression of genes in these two chromosomal types.
Analysis revealed that these differentially expressing genes are associated with bone differentiation, glucose metabolism, and gonadal development pathways.
This study also reported differential expression of non-coding RNAs (RNAs that cannot be transformed into proteins) in X cells with abnormal chromosome count.
This study provides a basis for evaluation of cellular and molecular mechanism(s) in the establishment of Turner syndrome phenotypes.
