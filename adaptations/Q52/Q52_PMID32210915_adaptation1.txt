What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy or condition of having abnormal number of chromosomes. The disease has a broad spectrum of symptoms including short stature, ovarian failure, and skeletal abnormalities.
The cause of TS is complex. The mechanisms driving its development are unclear.
In this study, an online database was used to identify differentially expressed (functionally unique) genes (DEGs) between monosomy X TS patients (one chromosome lacks its partner) and normal female individuals.
Data on 26 subjects with TS (45,XO) and 10 subjects with the normal chromosomal count (46,XX) was investigated.
Several genetic analyses were performed.
In total, 25 upregulated (increased in activity) and 60 downregulated (decreased in activity) genes were identified.
The system with the most highly enriched tissue-specific gene expression was the hematologic (blood) and immune system. This was followed by the skin/skeletal muscle and brain-related systems.
Additionally, analysis resulted in the identification of five genes of interest.
Two of these genes, CD99 and CSF2RA, are involved in the hematologic (blood)/immune system. Others, MYL9 and MYLPF, are related to the circulatory (heart and blood vessels) system. A fifth gene, IGFBP2, is related to skeletal abnormalities.
Additionally, several genes of interest with possible roles in the pathogenesis (disease creation) of TS were identified as being associated with the hematologic/immune system or metabolism.
This analysis may be a useful method for identifying novel mechanisms underlying TS.
However, more experiments are needed to explore the relationships between these genes and TS.
