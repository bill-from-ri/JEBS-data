What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

Turner syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormal number of chromosomes (genetic material).
Amniotic fluid, the fluid surrounding a fetus, could contribute to the understanding of Turner syndrome development.
In this pilot study, gene expression analysis of cell-free RNA (genetic material to create proteins) in amniotic fluid was analyzed. The fluid was evaluated to identify genes/organ systems that may play a role in Turner syndrome development.
Cell-free RNA from amniotic fluid of five mid-trimester Turner syndrome fetuses and five control female fetuses was extracted.
Significantly differentially (functionally unique) regulated genes were identified.
Biological interpretation was performed to determine gene expression.
There were 470 statistically significantly differentially expressed genes identified.
They were widely distributed across the genome.
XIST was significantly down-regulated (decreased in activity). SHOX was not differentially expressed.
One of the most highly represented organ systems was the hematologic (blood) and immune system.
Organization of the differentially expressed gene list identified genes of possible disease development significance.
Transcriptomic (RNA) differences in the amniotic fluid of Turner syndrome fetuses are due to genome-wide dysregulation.
The hematologic/immune system differences may play a role in early-onset autoimmune dysfunction (in which infection-fighting cells attack healthy cells).
Other genes identified with possible pathologic (harmful) significance were associated with cardiac (heart) and skeletal systems. These systems are known to be affected in females with Turner syndrome.
This data may be useful in identifying how Turner syndrome develops.
