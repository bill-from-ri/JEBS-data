Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Chronic wounds unresponsive to existing treatments constitute a serious disease burden.
Factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic ulcers include oxidative stress, comorbid microbial infections, and the type of immune system response.
Preclinically, and in a case study, a formulation containing a Ceratothoa oestroides olive oil extract promoted wound healing.
Patients with chronic venous and pressure ulcers, clinically assessed as being unresponsive to healing agents, were treated for 3 months with an ointment containing the C oestroides extract combined with antibiotic and/or antiseptic agents chosen according to the type of bacterial infection.
Treatment evaluation was performed using the Bates-Jensen criteria with +WoundDesk and MOWA cell phone applications.
After 3 months of treatment, C oestroides resulted in an average decrease of 36% in the Bates-Jensen score of ulcers (P < .000), with the decrease being significant from the first month (P < .007).
The combined use of topically applied antibiotics and antiseptics efficiently controlled microbial ulcer infection and facilitated wound healing.
In relation to other factors such as initial wound size, chronicity appeared to be an important prognostic factor regarding the extent of wound healing.
Future clinical investigations assessing the wound healing efficacy of the C oestroides olive oil extract are warranted.
