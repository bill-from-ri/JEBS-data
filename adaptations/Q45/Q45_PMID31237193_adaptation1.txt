Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Long-lasting wounds that do not respond to available treatments have serious impacts.
Things that determine how bedsores progress include low antioxidant levels, other infections caused by microbes (microorganisms), and the type of immune system response.
Before symptoms, and in a detailed study, a mixture containing a Ceratothoa oestroides (fish parasite) olive oil extract increased wound healing.
Patients with long-lasting leg ulcers (sores) due to blood flow problems and bedsores, determined by doctors as not responding to healing treatments, were treated for 3 months with an ointment with C oestroides extract combined with antibiotics (kill bacteria) and/or antiseptics (slow bacteria growth) based on type of bacterial infection.
We evaluated treatment using a common tool used to track wound healing with two cell phone apps.
After 3 months of treatment, C oestroides caused an average score decrease of 36% on a common tool used to track wound healing.
Applying both antibiotics and antiseptics controlled ulcer infection by microorganisms and helped wound healing.
Compared to things like initial wound size, how long lasting the wound was seemed to be an important factor in predicting how much the wound healed.
Future studies looking at how well C oestroides olive oil extract works to heal wounds are needed.
