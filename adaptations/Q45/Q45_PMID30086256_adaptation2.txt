Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

The study's objective is to evaulate the success of topical pentoxifylline (PTX) (a blood flow medication) on pressure ulcer (PU), or bedsore, healing in very ill patients.
In this study, patients with mild or moderate PUs were randomly assigned to receive either skin-level PTX 5% or a sham treatment twice daily for 14 days.
Changes in PU (severity and size) were measured.
The severity of PU was determined with a special scale at starting (day zero), day seven, and day 14 of the treatment.
PU length and width was measured with a ruler in cm2.
112 adult patients enrolled in the study.
Average PU size and score at day 0 were 32 cm2 and 1 respectively.
In the PTX group, the average differences of all PU scores and sizes decreased greatly across the intervals (day seven vs day zero, day 14 vs day zero, and day 14 vs day seven), compared with the sham treatment group.
The severity and size of PUs improved greatly in patients who received skin-level PTX 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared to those in the dummy treatment group.
Skin-level PTX may be a possible option to treat mild and moderate PUs in very ill patients.
