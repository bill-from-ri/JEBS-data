Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

We aimed to study the effect of Ma Yinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoids Cream combined with pearl powder on pain and side effects in patients with serious bedsores.
We divided 117 patients hospitalized with serious bedsores in our hospital (January 2019-December 2019) into the Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream Group (MY Group), Pearl Powder Group (PP Group), and combination with Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder Group (MP group), 39 patients in each group.
Patients in the three groups generally were similar.
We looked at the effects of Mayinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoid Cream combined with pearl powder in the treatment of pain and side effects in patients with serious bedsores based on differences in how well a treatment works, side effects, scar occurrence, pain, and quality of care of patients in the MY, PP, and MP groups.
The MP group treatment worked better than the MY and PP groups.
The MP group had better healing time and dressing change times than the MY group.
The MP group had a better score on a common scoring tool for pain and fewer side effects than the MY and PP groups.
The MP group had less occurrence of scars and smaller scar area than the MY and PP groups.
A combination of Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder worked better than either treatment by itself in treating severe bedsore patients, and can significantly reduce pain in the affected area and side effects.
