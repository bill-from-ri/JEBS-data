Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Scientists have not yet measured the effect of nifedipine, a drug to treat high blood pressure and chest pain, on bedsores in humans.
In this study, we looked at the effect of applying nifedipine 3% ointment to the skin on bedsore healing in critically ill patients.
This was a medical study involving human participants in which neither side knew who was getting what treatment and ointment with no medicine was given to a control group.
In this study, we randomly gave 200 patients with stage I or II, according to a common scoring system to measure the severity of bedsores, nifedipine ointment applied to the skin or ointment with no medicine two times a day for 14 days.
The most important outcome was changes in the size and stage of bedsores.
We used the bedsore scoring scale to measure bedsore stage at the beginning of the study and on study days 7 and 14.
We estimated the surface area of the bedsores by multiplying width by length.
In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study.
We compared patients with similar bedsore stage and size at the beginning of the study.
The group given nifedipine had significantly higher average decrease in bedsore stage than the group not given nifedipine on days 7 and 14.
The group given nifedipine had significantly higher average decrease in bedsore surface area than the group not given nifedipine on days 7 and 14.
We conclude that nifedipine 3% ointment applied to the skin for 14 days significantly improved the healing process of stage I or II bedsores in critically ill patients.
