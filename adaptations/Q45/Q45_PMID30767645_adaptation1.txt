Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Products that serve as a barrier to protect the skin are important in defending the skin against chemically damaging effects of bodily fluids, including fluid produced from the healing process, urine, liquid faeces, output from an opening in the body and sweat.
Many treatments exist, which can be grouped based on ingredients.
This study describes the differences in how barrier products work, including petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and/or zinc oxide, polymers (substances made of very large molecules) that form silicone (type of polymer) film, and cyanoacrylates (group of strong fast-acting adhesives).
Studies suggest all barrier products work, with few studies that compare ingredients to show one works better than another. Film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates are easier to apply and cost less.
Limited lab data suggest that a concentrated cyanoacrylate made a more notable layer that stuck more to pig tissue than a less-concentrated cyanoacrylate and protected the skin from rubbing and moisture better than a film-forming polymer.
Finally, a silicon-based cream with vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts significantly reduced bedsore occurrence when used with other approaches.
