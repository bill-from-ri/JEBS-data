Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Bedsores often seriously affect the quality of life of patients.
Bedsores can be treated with Moist Exposed Burn Ointment (MEBO).
Our study aimed to rate how well MEBO works and how safe MEBO is in the treatment of bedsores in Chinese patients.
We randomly put 72 bedsore patients in two groups and gave them MEBO or ointment with no medicine for 2 months.
The most important outcomes were wound surface area and a common bedsore scoring tool.
We also looked at a common scoring tool for pain, questionnaire of ulcer (sore) status, and side effects.
Sixty-seven patients did the study.
After 2 months of treatment, MEBO resulted in a greater average change from the beginning of the study compared to ointment with no medicine for wound surface area and both scoring tools.
The questionnaire indicated MEBO "completely healed" bedsores in patients after 2 months of treatment versus ointment with no medicine.
We found no major side effects in the 2 groups.
We showed that MEBO works with no major side effects for improving would healing in Chinese patients with bedsores.
