How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin is a new drug to treat seizures that appears to work well for patients.
It is absorbed into the body by an active and fluid-filled transport system, and is able to be distributed to tissues in the body.
Gabapentin is not attached to proteins in the blood, does not create liver enzymes that can speed up chemical reactions in the body, and is not broken down.
When the amount of the drug in the body is the same amount that is being cleared, the time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or body to be reduced by half is 6-8 hours and is eliminated through the kidneys.
Gabapentin does not have any major interactions with other drugs when given with other standard drugs that treat seizures or with oral (by mouth) birth control.
In 3 clinical studies, gabapentin used as an add-on anti-seizure drug to assist the main treatment reduces the frequency of partial seizures (impacting half the brain) and seizures (impacting both halves of the brain).
The medicine is handled well by patients, with drowsiness and dizziness being the most common side effects.
Although the exact process of how gabapentin can lead to an effect is not fully understood, there is strong evidence that suggests a new process in the body.
Gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve the quality of life of patients with epilepsy (seizure disorders) and is a welcome addition to currently available drugs for the treatment of patients with seizures that start in one part of the brain.
