How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin (GBP) is a nerve-related pain medication that is mainly removed from the body in urine, and is also processed by the kidneys.
The objective of this study is to evaluate how gabapentin may interact with another medicine called cetirizine (CTZ) that is used to temporarily relieve allergies.
A clinical trial in patients with a shooting or burning pain caused by damage to the nervous system called neuropathic pain is conducted to understand the effect of cetirizine on how gabapentin is processed in the body.
In this study, 12 patients are treated with either one dose of gabapentin (called Treatment A) or with cetirizine for 5 days and gabapentin given on the last day of cetirizine (Treatment B).
Blood samples are taken and the level of pain is measured up to 36 hours after gabapentin is taken.
The interaction of gabapentin and cetirizine is analyzed.
Cetirizine treatment resulted a reduced time the body is exposed to the medication and reduced peak amount when compared with Treatment A (one dose of gabapentin).
In treatment B, the lower concentrations of gabapentin or GBP in the blood results in reduced pain.
GBP clearance from the kidneys is similar between treatments A and B.
GBP appears to bind less to some receptors or kidney target sites such as OCT2 and attach more towards others such as hMATE1 in certain human kidney cells.
At certain concentrations, CTZ interacts with transporters in the body that move materials across cells.
In summary, cetirizine  (CTZ) reduces the exposure to gabapentin (GBP) and its effect on neuropathic pain.
However, CTZ Ã— GBP interaction is not influenced by the transporters in the kidney.
