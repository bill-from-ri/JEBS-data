How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin is a new antiseizure or antiepileptic drug (AED) with attractive drug activity.
Gabapentin is absorbed by an active transport system. The drug has a large distribution.
Gabapentin is not bound to blood proteins, does not activate liver enzymes and is not broken down.
Normally, half of the drug is eliminated in 6-8 hours. It is cleared unchanged by the kidney with a blood clearance similar to standard kidney substance clearance.
The drug does not have major drug-drug interactions when used with other AEDs or swallowed birth control drugs.
Gabapentin used as an add-on AED greatly reduces the amount of partial seizures and partial seizures developing into standard serizures in three clinical trials.
The drug is well tolerated, with temporary drowsiness and dizziness as the most common side effects.
Although how gabapentin works is unknown, there is evidence for a new mechanism of its biological action.
Gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve life for patients with epilepsy (a brain disorder causing seizures). The drug is a welcome addition to current AEDs for treating patients with seizures of partial onset.
