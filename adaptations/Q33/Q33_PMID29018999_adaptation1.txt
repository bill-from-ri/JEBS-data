How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

The objective of this study is to perform an analysis on how the nerve-related pain medication gabapentin performs in healthy Korean participants and to investigate the possible effect of genetic changes in the drug-resistant ABCB1 gene on how gabapentin is absorbed and distributed in the body.
Data are collected from other studies where 173 people received three different doses by mouth (orally) of gabapentin.
Only data on the drug design and performance are used.
How the body handles and uses gabapentin is measured.
Gabapentin shows a lot of variation or differences between people in how it is absorbed, distributed and released from the body.
Blood concentration of gabapentin is used to understand the process of distributing and eliminating the medication from the body.
How the dose amount impacts availability in the body is measured.
The oral clearance is estimated to be 11.1 liters per hour.
The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L.
How quickly the medication enters the body remains steady.
Availability of the drug from the oral dose is estimated to be 68.8% at a dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at a dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at a dose of 800 mg.
Clearing creatinine (a waste product that comes from wear and tear of the muscles) influences the oral clearance, and ABCB1 genes influence how quickly gabapentin is absorbed by the body.
However, genes showed no significant effect on gabapentin drug activity parameters.
The results of this study suggest that the availability of gabapentin to the body when taken by mouth is decreased when the dosage is increased.
In addition, changes in the ABCB1 gene can explain the major differences in how gabapentin is absorbed by the body between people.
