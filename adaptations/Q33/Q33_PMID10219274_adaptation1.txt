How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

This study is conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal or kidney function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (or drug activity) of orally (by mouth) administered gabapentin (GBP).
The body's process of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing a single oral dose (by mouth) of gabapentin is studied in 36 healthy patients (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years.
Blood and urine samples are continuously collected for 48 hours after the dose of gabapentin.
The amount of Gabapentin in plasma (or blood) and urine samples are measured, and other tests are done to understand how the body processes gabapentin.
All patients are able to handle the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported.
No change in the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, the time at which the highest gabapentin amount occurred, or apparent volume of distribution (the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids) with age was noted.
A major decline in clearance of gabapentin that is taken orally, the rate of removal from the body, and clearing it through the kidneys with increasing age is observed.
The decline of oral clearance and rate of removal of gabapentin from the body can be explained by the decline in clearance by the kidneys.
The only measure that is very different between genders is the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, which is approximately 25% higher for women than for men, consistent with gender differences in body size.
In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that changes in kidney function are responsible for age-related changes in how the body processes gabapentin.
Giving a lesser dose of gabapentin may be required in elderly patients who have weaker kidney functions.
How the body processes gabapentin is similar in men and women.
