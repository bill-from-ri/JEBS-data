How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

How the pediatric or child patients with uncontrolled seizures are able to handle gabapentin (a nerve-related pain medication) and the processes of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing it is studied.
In this study, 13 pediatric patients (less the 21 years old) with an average age of about 9 years with uncontrolled partial seizures are included.
Patients received gabapentin orally (by mouth) until doses are changed for each patient.
Blood samples are obtained just before the dose and over 8 hours after gabapentin is given during fasting, when all foods have been completely digested.
Blood concentrations of gabapentin is measured by blood tests.
Absorption, distribution, use, and removal of gabapentin in the body is analyzed.
Data from 9 patients are able to be used for analysis.
The maximum concentration of the drug and the time it takes to reach maximum concentration are estimated.

Five patients experience moderate (4 patients) to severe (1 patient) aggressive behavior, and another gained weight on gabapentin.
In conclusion, the data in this study suggests that how the body processes gabapentin can vary a lot among pediatric patients.
In this study, patients with uncontrolled partial seizures were able to handle gabapentin well up to 6 months of therapy.
