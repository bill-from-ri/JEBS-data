How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the nervous system (like brain and spinal cord) and is often described as a shooting pain, burning sensation, or numbness. Gabapentin is a common medication used to treat neuropathic pain, including neuropathic pain caused by diabetes.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of diabetes and controlling blood sugar on people taking gabapentin.
A clinical trial is conducted in patients with neuropathic pain due to type 2 diabetes (19 people) or a slipped disc in the neck or spine (10 people).
All participants are treated with a single dose of gabapentin by mouth.
Blood is sampled up to 24 hours after gabapentin is given.
Data are analyzed using computer models.
Other information are included in the model including weight, sex, kidney functions and other changes in genes that impact how the medication works.

The total clearance of gabapentin from the body depends on how well the kidneys are able to process and filter the drug.
The estimated total clearance of the drug (completely removed) in the population is 14.7 liters per hour.
No major association is found with having high blood sugar levels, a diabetes diagnosis, or with age, sex, weight or other factors evaluated.
This model studying how the drug is processed in the body estimates gabapentin concentrations in patients with neuropathic pain.
The distribution and clearance processes of gabapentin are not affected by having high blood sugar levels or diabetes.
