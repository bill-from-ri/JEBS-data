How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin is an antiseizure drug, which in man is cleared just by kidney removal and is not bound to blood proteins.
Because gabapentin clearance is dependent on kidney function, the drug activity of gabapentin was investigated in patients unable to make urine and maintained on artifical kidney machines or hemodialysis.
We took blood samples over an 8-day period after treatment of single 400-mg swallowed doses of gabapentin.
Blood and kidney solution samples were obtained during treatment sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing.
An average maximum gabapentin blood level of 6.0 micrograms/mL was measured at 4.7 hours after the dose.
The time for half of gabapentin to clear on non-hemodialysis days was 132 hours.
Around 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in the fluid of the artificial kidney machine. The average hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 mL/min; around 93% of the standard dialyzer clearance.
The time for half of gabapentin to clear during hemodialysis was around 4 hours.
Blood gabapentin levels increased around 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis due to drug redistribution in the body.
It is recommended that patients with kidney failure and on hemodialysis get an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin starting dose.
Blood gabapentin levels can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis.
