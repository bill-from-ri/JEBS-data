How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Data on how gabapentin (GBP -a nerve-related pain medication) is used in the body in elderly patients show a major effect of older age on how the drug works due to changes in kidney function.
However, there are no data in elderly nursing home patients to evaluate how the body absorbs and removes gabapentin.
The objective of this study is to describe how the body uses and processes gabapentin in elderly nursing home patients who are on gabapentin.
This study observed elderly nursing home patients (â‰¥60 years) receiving gabapentin for chronic (ongoing) pain or epilepsy (seizure disorders) from 7 nursing homes.

Data on gabapentin and the clearance of the drug are associated with the rate that measures how well the kidneys are working.
The gabapentin clearance in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 liters per hour.
After accounting for the rate that measures how well the kidneys are working, GBP clearance is not affected by age, sex, body weight, or other illnesses and their medications.
No significant effects of body size measures, age, and sex are detected on volume of distribution, the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids.
The availability of the drug being dependent on dosage is shown, and how it is absorbed is calculated.
Additional calculations are done on the entire group to evaluate the performance of the drug and identify other individual factors that may impact the effect.
In this analysis, the patterns of the drug appear to be similar between elderly and younger adults.
