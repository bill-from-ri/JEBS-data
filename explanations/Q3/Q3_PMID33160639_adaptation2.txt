How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia (high blood potassium) is an electrolyte issue with possibly life-threatening effects.
No agreement exists for treating high blood potassium. Guidelines vary based on postassium level and management of immediate or long-lasting high blood potassium.
This review identifies many issues and needs regarding high blood potassium.
Real-world studies are needed to better understand the real-world widespreadness of high blood potassium.
Improving treatment of high blood potassium, including classification, potassium monitoring, and specific medication use, is necessary.
While monitoring blood potassium should be individualized, increased monitoring should be considered for those with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, history of high blood potassium, or enzyme-based therapy which blocks kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes.
New potassium binders (patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) may help renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapy, which blocks kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes.
Improving understanding of these newer potassium binders may increase confidence in helping those with high blood potassium.
The availability of newer K+ binders needs more research to determine if more strict dietary K+ restrictions are needed for patients.
Personalized blood potassium monitoring in those with high risk of high blood potassium and new potassium-binding agents may improve certain kidney-related, enzyme-based therapies and management of high blood potassium.
