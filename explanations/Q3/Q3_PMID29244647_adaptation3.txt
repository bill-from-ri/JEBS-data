How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is a very important mineral in the body.  Hyperkalemia can be caused by too much potassium coming out of the cells into the blood. It can also be caused when the kidneys are not getting rid of enough potassium from the body through the urine.
Hyperkalemia is temporary when too much comes out of the cells into the bloodstream. But, when the kidneys cannot get rid of enough potassium from the body, the hyperkalemia can last a longer time.
