How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is a very important mineral in the body. Hyperkalemia is often seen in patients with ongoing kidney disease. Hyperkalemia can cause serious problems with your heartbeat and an increased risk of death.
Doctors consider severe hyperkalemia a medical emergency and treat it immediately. They also give treatments to try to stop it from coming back.
Current treatments for ongoing hyperkalemia include avoiding things that can cause it to come back. Doctors advise not to eat foods or take supplements that are high in potassium and to stop using medicines that are known to increase the potassium level.
Some of the most commonly uses medicines that are known to increase potassium levels are a class of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS blockers). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Often as the first step, doctors stop giving patients these medicines to prevent hyperkalemia from coming back.
While stopping these medicines usually works well to lower the potassium level, patients miss out on the known kidney protection this class of drugs can give.
Newer medicines have now been developed that bind to potassium. These new potassium binders allow doctors to lower the potassium level in a different way. Doctors may now be able to lower potassium levels and still keep their patients on the RAAS blockers for the kidney protection these medicines give.
This research studies hyperkalemia and its effects. This work also shows the many (and new) ways of treating hyperkalemia and how the treatment can help the patients.
