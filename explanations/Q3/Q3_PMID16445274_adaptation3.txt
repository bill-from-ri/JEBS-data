How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is an important mineral in the body. Hyperkalemia is caused by problems with potasium metabolism and it can be life-threatening. It can be caused by a problem with the kidneys getting rid of the potassium through the urine. It can also be caused by a problem moving potassium into the cells from the bloodstream or both. 
Hyperkalemia that comes on rapidly is usually caused by an illness, dehydration, or by starting medicines that affect normal potassium balance in the body.
Hyperkalemia can also be caused by other syndromes or conditions in patients with kidney diseases that are caused by diabetes.
Signs that hyperkalemia may be life-threatening include EKG changes that are typically seen with high potassium levels or by a rapid rise in potassium levels on a blood test.
Urine tests for potassium, creatinine (a waste product from muscles), and osmolality (the kidney's ability to balance water in urine) should be done as a first step in finding the cause for the hyperkalemia. Finding the cause for the hyperkalemia will have an effect on the ongoing treatment.
Giving calcium through an IV can improve the abnormal EKG changes and reduce the risk of abnormal heartbeats, but this treatment does not lower the blood potassium level.
Blood potassium levels can be lowered quickly by giving IV insulin and glucose, and by giving medicines called beta2 agonists through an inhaler or both.
To then lower total body potassium levels, sodium polystyrene (a potassium-binding medicine) is started, sometimes with IV Lasix and saline.
