How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. Potassium is a very important mineral in the body. Hyperkalemia is a important problem that happens mostly in people with long-lasting kidney disease.
Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency because it can cause problems with the heart beat and the nerves.
Doctors will stop the medicines that can cause increases in potassium blood levels as one of many ways to treat hyperkalemia.
Many of these medicines that can cause hyperkalemia have also shown good effects on the heart, circulation, and kidneys. These medicines include a class of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS blockers). The RAAS is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Because these medicines also have good effects, stopping them may not be the best solution.
Two newer medicines that bind to potassium are coming out to treat hyperkalemia. These potassium-binding medicines may soon allow doctors to continue to use the RAAS blockers that may increase the blood potassium levels, even in patients who may get hyperkalemia.
This research studies the way potassium is handled in the body under normal conditions and in hyperkalemia. it also studies hyperkalemia in the population and how doctors treat rapidly occurring and ongoing hyperkalemia.
We thoroughly discuss the information coming out about these new medicines that can lower potassium. We also discuss how doctors can use them in the future.
