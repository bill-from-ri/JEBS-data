How can i reduce my potassium levels?

Hyperkalemia (high blood potassium) is common in those with long-lasting kidney disease. It is linked to higher risk of death and a harmful, irregular heart beat.
Severe high blood potassium is serious, requires immediate treatment, and should be actively prevented.
Current treatment for high blood potassium includes eliminating potassium in diets, supplements, and medications known to raise potassium.
Medication that blocks kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolyte balance are usually removed by clinicians to prevent the return of high blood potassium.
While removing kidney-related medication helps, patients do not receive the kidney-protecting benefits of the medication.
New potassium binders have greatly influenced high blood potassium monitoring. They allow the continued use of helpful kidney-related medication that may promote high blood potassium.
This article reviews the effects of high blood potassium and its treatment.
