How long is covid 19 communicable?

The goal of this paper was to summarize scientific reports detailing the amount of time someone positive for (or with) COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) can infect others.
To do this, the authors reviewed papers published in public databases (e.g. PubMed, Europe PubMed Central, EMBASE) between the dates of January 1, 2020 to August 26, 2020.
Fifteen studies were identified for review. Thirteen reports focused on COVID-19 that was grown within a laboratory (in culture) from human biological sampling. Two studies followed contact tracing between humans.
For 5 viral culture studies, the last day that COVID-19 was able to be identified in biological samples was 10 days before symptoms occurred.
For another 5 culture studies, COVID-19 was identified in biological samples past day 10.
The remaining 3 virus culture studies evaluated patients with severe or critical COVID-19 illness. COVID-19 was isolated up to 32 days in one of these studies.
Two studies identified immunocompromised patients (patients with decreased immune function) from whom COIVD-19 was able to be isolated from for up to 20 days.
For both contact tracing or spreading studies, when exposure occurred more than five days after symptoms were apparent, there was no evidence of COVID-19 spreading.
The authors concluded that COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms are unlikely to spread the virus to others beyond 10 days of symptoms.
However, studies have shown that patients with severe to critical symptoms, or those who are immunocompromised, may spread the virus for longer periods of time.
