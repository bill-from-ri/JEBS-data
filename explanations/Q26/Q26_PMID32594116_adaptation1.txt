How long is covid 19 communicable?

Patients recovering from COVID-19 (a viral respiratory disease) oftentimes continue to test positive for (or have) the virus. This can make "return to work" plans difficult.
The goal of this study is to evaluate COVID-19's ability to spread by determining the amount of the virus within an organism, known as the viral load, over time.
Health care personnel at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified.
The viral load within the personnel was calculated.
The link between the viral load within the patient and the first day of symptoms was evaluated.
The viral load per day since the beginning of symptom onset within the patient were predicted using statistical models.
Over six weeks, 230 health care personnel had 528 tests performed.
The viral load within patients decreased within a few days of the beginning of virus-related symptoms.
The viral load within the patient was significantly linked to time since onset of symptoms.
The majority of the participants had peak viral load within the first 7 to 10 days.
Findings were similar when other statistical tests were run.
The authors concluded that among patients with no mild to moderate COVID-19, viral loads peaked by 2 or 3 days from symptom onset and decreased rapidly thereafter.
The largest amount of viral load was on average within 10 days of symptom onset.
