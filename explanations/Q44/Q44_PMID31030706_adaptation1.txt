What percent of blood loss shows the sign symptom of hypovolemic shocks begin?

Hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) is the leading cause of preventable death in combat. However, early recognition of hemorrhage is still challenging on the battlefield.
The aim of this study was to describe the shock index (SI) in a healthy military population. Additionally, the paper aimed to measure SI variation during a controlled blood loss, simulated by blood donation.
A study that enrolled military subjects, volunteers for blood donation, was conducted.
Demographic (e.g. age, race) and clinical information, concerning both the patient and the blood collection, were recorded.
Vital signs were measured before and after donation.
Statistical analysis was performed after calculation of SI.
A total of 483 participants were included in the study.
The average blood donation volume was 473 mL.
The median (average) pre- and post-blood donation SI were significantly different.
Changes in pre-/post-donation blood pressure and heart rate were also different. However, the difference was of clinically poor relevance.
A statistical analysis showed no significant associations between SI variations and age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sport activities, blood donation volume, and enteral (intestinal) volume replacement (EVR).
The study concluding that SI exhibited significant variations (differences) but failed to reach clinical relevance.
Further studies are needed to prove the benefit of SI calculation as a possible method of early recognition of hemorrhage in combat casualties.
