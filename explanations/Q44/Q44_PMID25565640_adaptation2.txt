What percent of blood loss shows the sign symptom of hypovolemic shocks begin?

Current monitoring technologies cannot detect early, counterbalancing changes associated with significant blood loss.
We previously showed a new mathematical equation to calculate the counterbalancing blood flow mechanics or Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) based on analysis of blood vessel wave patterns from blood flow recordings.
In the present study, we theorized that CRI would give better accuracy to detect blood loss compared to standard vital signs and other blood flow measures.
We analyzed 20 subjects before, during, and after a regular, controlled voluntary blood loss of 1.2 liters for continuous non-surgical vital sign wave data, including CRI, recordings, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, blood flow output, and blood volume.
CRI decreased by 33% in a linear trend across increasing blood volume loss, with no changes in vital signs.
CRI had high accuracy for detecting blood volume loss.
In comparison, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, blood flow output and blood volume had less accuracy for detecting the same amount of blood loss.
Consistent with out theory, CRI detected blood loss and restoration better than other traditional body measures.
Single measurement of CRI may enable better identification, while CRI monitoring may allow earlier detection of patient status trending towards death.
