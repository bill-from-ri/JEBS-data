What percent of blood loss shows the sign symptom of hypovolemic shocks begin?

Development of a human model of hemorrhage has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the underlying physiology that defines the individual capacity to avoid the life-threatening clinical condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as “shock.”
The experimental approach of progressively reducing central blood volume to the point of hemodynamic decompensation with the use of lower body negative pressure has revealed stark distinctions in the physiological compensatory responses between individuals with high compared with low tolerances to blood loss.
High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump.
When the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue.
When cardiac filling is no longer adequate to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a reflex-mediated pronounced bradycardia leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.
