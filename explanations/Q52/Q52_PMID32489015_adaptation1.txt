What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

47,XXX (triple X) and Turner syndrome (45,X) are sex chromosomal (gene material) abnormalities with detrimental effects on health. Both syndromes are associated with increased death and disease suffering.
In females with normal chromosomes, X-chromosome (sex chromosome) inactivation balances gene expression between sexes. Upregulation (increase in activity) of the X chromosome in both sexes maintains balance with the autosomes (chromosomes not involved in sex determination).
In both syndromes, a gene dosage imbalance may be caused by increased or decreased expression from the genes that escape X inactivation. A gene dosage imbalance may also be caused by incomplete X chromosome inactivation in 47,XXX.
This study aimed to evaluate genome-wide DNA-methylation (addition of methyl groups to DNA) and RNA (genetic material)-expression changes. This was done in the hope that these alterations may explain phenotypic traits, or observable character traits, associated with 47,XXX syndrome.
This study compared DNA-methylation and RNA-expression data taken from white blood cells of seven women with 47,XXX syndrome. This data was compared with data from seven female controls and seven women with Turner syndrome (45,X).
This study evaluated genome-wide DNA-methylation and RNA data in blood from seven females with 47,XXX syndrome, seven females with Turner syndrome, and seven normal females (46,XX).
The study identified the loss of methylation of six X-chromosomal genes, increased methylation for one specific gene, and four differentially methylated autosomal regions related to four genes.
This data illustrates how these changes seem centered at the RNA level.
In conclusion, this study suggests an impact of excess X chromosome in 47,XXX syndrome on the methylation status of selected genes.
