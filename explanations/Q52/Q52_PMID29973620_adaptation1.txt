What level of gene expression from transcription to protein does turner syndrome impact?

Turner Syndrome (TS) is a condition where several genes are affected. However, how this occurs remains unknown. Turner syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormal amount of chromosomes (genetic material).
Identifying the genes that regulate the TS network is one of the main challenges in understanding its cause.
This study evaluated the regulatory network of genes reported in scientific literature and identified essential proteins involved in TS.
A statistical evaluation was completed to model a TS network.

Out of twenty-seven genes, the authors identified two key regulators (KRs) i.e. KDM6A and BDNF.
These KRs serve as the backbone for all the network activities.
Removal of KRs does not cause its breakdown, rather a change in the network properties was observed.
Essential (necessary) proteins are evolutionarily conserved (kept). Because of this, genes of selected interacting proteins in C. elegans, cat, and macaque monkey were identified.
The authors deciphered three important interologs, interactions between pairs of proteins.
In conclusion, these KRs and identified interologs are expected to regulate the TS network. This data demonstrates their biological importance.
