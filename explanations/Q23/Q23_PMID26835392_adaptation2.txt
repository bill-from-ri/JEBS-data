How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited, metabolic disorder caused by a lack of a specific liver enzyme or protein.
If left untreated, phenylketonuria may lead to intellectual disability.
Treating PKU includes a diet low in the molecule Phenylalanine and completed with other molecules. The diet starts within the first weeks of life after identification.
While dietary treatment prevents intellectual disability in patients with early treated PKU, the diet is hard to follow due to its taste.
Other issues with dietary treatment include deficiencies in vitamin D and B12.
Patients that do not follow the diet experience low cognitive function.
There have been many attempts to improve the diet including its taste.
Changes like using new amino acids and protein units have been explored.
Gene therapy and enzyme replacement have been more promising recently.
This article reviews current and possible treatments for PKU.
