How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a large number of mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus, most of which are strongly associated with specific RFLP or VNTR haplotypes.
One of the major questions remaining in PKU research is why this apparently maladaptive disorder has been maintained at a frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000 among Caucasians.
A growing number of studies have provided evidence that both the relatively high frequency of PKU and the strong mutation/haplotype associations might reflect the existence of multiple founding populations for PKU.
Examples of putative founding populations for PKU in both Europe and Asia will be presented.
Some PAH mutations are associated with multiple haplotypes, suggesting recurrence.
Evidence for and against recurrence as the mechanism responsible for the association of the R408W mutation with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 2 will be discussed.
