How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy. This is caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) that changes one molecule into another molecule.
If not treated, PKU causes higher phenylalanine levels in the blood and brain, which causes intellectual disability, seizure disorder and behavioral problems.
The European guidelines on PKU were made to improve and reduce the variation or differences in care because PKU treatment differs a lot across Europe.
