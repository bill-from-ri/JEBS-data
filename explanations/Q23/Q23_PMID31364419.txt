How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is considered to be a paradigm for a monogenic metabolic disorder but was never thought to be a primary application for human gene therapy due to established alternative treatment.
However, somewhat unanticipated improvement in neuropsychiatric outcome upon long-term treatment of adults with PKU with enzyme substitution therapy might slowly change this assumption.
In parallel, PKU was for a long time considered to be an excellent test system for experimental gene therapy of a Mendelian autosomal recessive defect of the liver due to an outstanding mouse model and the easy to analyze and well-defined therapeutic end point, that is, blood l-phenylalanine concentration.
Lifelong treatment by targeting the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was achieved using different approaches, including (1) recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) or nonviral naked DNA vector-based gene addition, (2) genome editing using base editors delivered by rAAV vectors, and (3) by delivering rAAVs for promoter-less insertion of the PAH-cDNA into the Pah locus.
In this article we summarize the gene therapeutic attempts of correcting a mouse model for PKU and discuss the future implications for human gene therapy.
