How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy due to lack of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) in the liver.
PKU can cause intellectual disability if not treated.
Treatment, which includes a low phenylalanine diet with formulas containing molecules that form proteins, begins soon after diagnosis within the first weeks of life.
Although treatment diets prevent intellectual disability in PKU patients treated early, many patients do not follow the diets because they do not taste good.
Treatment diets also may lack certain nutrients, especially vitamin D and B12.
Patients who do not follow the diets generally show poorer performance in some mental skills.
Work has been done to improve the quality of medical diets including their taste.
Using certain molecules that form certain proteins are examples of ways to improve medical diets.
Transferring genetic material into a patient's cell and replacing or substituting a substance that is lacking in the PKU patient's body have been successful in recent years.
In this review, we discuss current and possible future treatments for PKU.
