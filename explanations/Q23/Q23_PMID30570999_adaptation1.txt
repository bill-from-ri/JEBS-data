How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy often caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) that changes one molecule (phenylalanine, Phe) into another molecule (tyrosine, Tyr).
PKU is a type of molecular (amino acid) metabolism disorder called "toxic accumulation IEMs," in which the buildup of the molecule is toxic.
Changes to DNA of a protein, such as PAH, are made in both copies of the gene that is altered, because one working copy of the gene allows the protein to function.

PAH is mainly a liver protein.
PKU is associated with high blood Phe levels and low Tyr levels.
Newborns with PKU can look normal at birth with the first signs showing many months later.
Signs of PKU can include a musty smell from skin and pee, fair skin, red and itchy skin, seizures, tremors, and an active and disruptive behavior.
