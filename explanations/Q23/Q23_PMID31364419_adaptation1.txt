How is phenylketonuria inherited?

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a model of a disorder controlled by a single gene in which the body cannot properly turn some food into energy. However, scientists didn't consider transferring genetic material into a PKU patient's cells due to other working treatments.
However, unexpected mental function improvements after long-term treatment of adults with PKU by substituting a substance that is lacking in the PKU patient's body might change this belief.
In the same way, PKU was thought to be a great test for trying to transfer genetic material into a patient's cells to help a liver disorder inherited from both parents due to a great mouse model and measurable blood levels of l-phenylalanine (a substance transformed by the missing protein in PKU).
Lifelong treatment by focusing on the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was done using three different approaches.
In this paper, we summarize future impacts for transferring genetic material into a patient's cells.
