How is phenylketonuria inherited?

"Inborn errors of metabolism," first identified 100 years ago by Garrod, are metabolic errors from birth and important evidence for chemical and biological individuality.
Asbjörn Fölling identified phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited physical disorder, in 1934.
PKU impairs cognitive development due to toxic buildup of a specific molecule, phenylalanine.
The metabolic characteristics of PKU occur due to nurture, in which a normal diet includes the molecule L-phenylalanine, and nature, where DNA mutations influence the gene that creates the L-phenylalanine breakdown enzyme.
The phenylalanine breakdown enzyme converts PKU into another molecule, tyrosine, using oxygen and non-protein helpers.
PKU is among the first genetic diseases to enter, via newborn testing, publich health and demonstrate the use of successful treatment.
This success of treatment has shifted attitudes about genetic diseases.
PKU shows how DNA and genes affect physical traits, how modern humans have evolved, and how genetic databases now exist to document genetic mutations.
Every individual has unique, physical characteristics involving PKU that require unique treatment.
PKU shows the genetic components of disease and health.
