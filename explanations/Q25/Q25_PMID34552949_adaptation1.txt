When do monoclonal antibodies have to be given for covid?

Coronavirus variants of concern (variants that are easier to transmit and/or are more severe) show reduced effect from monoclonal antibodies which are drugs that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce.
Researchers tested equine or horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (antibody drugs that attack several parts of the COVID-19 virus) that are being tested in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta.
The results show that equine polyclonal antibodies efficiently make the variant of concern ineffective.
Equine polyclonal antibodies are found to be an effective, low-cost, and accessible COVID-19 treatment for the variants of concern.
