Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are drugs that are often used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seixures. Long-term BDZ use and dependence negatively affect cognitive functioning (thinking ability). These effects can be partially irreversible.
New evidence suggests that pregabalin (PGB) might be a safe and effective treatment of long-term BDZ use.
The goal of the study was investigate the changes in cognitive function after successful treatment of long-term BDZ use and dependence with PGB.
Fourteen patients with long-term BDZ use underwent several neurological (brain-related) and cognititive function tests. These evaluations were conducted before the initiation of PGB treatment and at a two months follow-up after the cessation (stopping) of BDZs.
Patients' scores from the tests were compared with control data.
Patients improved on several cognitive measures with strong effect sizes.
By contrast, they failed to improve on measures of attentional flexibility (the ability to shift focus).
Despite their significant improvement, patients' scores on most tests were low when compared to control scores.
The study findings suggest that successful treatment of long-term BDZ use with PGB is associated (linked) with a substantial, though only partial, recovery of BDZ-compromised brain function, at least at a 2-month follow-up.
