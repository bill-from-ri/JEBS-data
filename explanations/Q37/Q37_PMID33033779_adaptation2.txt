Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Side effects of the brain and spine are commonly reported with pregabalin (PGB), a common nerve pain medication.
However, movement disorders (MDs) linked with this drug were rarely described.
Still, their occurence could affect the quality of life of PGB users.
This review evaluates the distribution, disease-causing mechanisms, and treatment of PGB-associated MDs.
Two reviewers without language issues identified and checked relevant reports in six databases.
46 reports with 305 cases from 17 countries were assessed.
The reported MDs include: 184 people with ataxia (impaired coordination), 61 with tremors (shaking movements), 39 with myoclonus (muscle jerks), 8 with parkinsonism (movement abnormalities from a brain disorder), 1 with restless legs syndrome (uncontrollable urge to move legs), 1 with dystonia (repetitive, twisting movements), 1 with dyskinesia (erratic movements), and 1 with akathisia (muscle quivering).
Average age was 62 years.
Proportion of male sex was 54.34%.
Average PGB medication dose when MD occured was 238 mg. Nerve-related pain was the most common effect of PGB.
Time from PGB start to MD was <1 month at 75%.
Time from PGD drug use withdrawal to recovery was < 1 week at 77%.
All individuals with a reported follow-up or later examination had a full recovery.
Most common management was PGB drug withdrawal.
In the text, many cases did not report information about timeline events, brain-related exam details, or details about the electrical activity of the body.
The best treatment for all MDs is likely PGB drug use stoppage.
If the patient is on an artificial kidney machine, perhaps more sessions will decrease recovery time.
Also, adding a benzodiazepine, an anti-anxiety and anti-seizure drug, could quicken recovery.
