Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Herpes zoster (shingles) is an immediate, painful, skin disease involved with reactivating the chickenpox virus. It may cause viral meningitis (inflamation of the brain and spine).
Pregabalin, common nerve pain medication, helps treat pain from herpes zoster.
However, pregabalin can be toxic to the nervous system.
We describe a 68-year-old female with herpes zoster and treated with pregabalin.
The patient had stuttering and frequent eye twitching after 3 days of using pregabalin.
Pregabalin use was stopped. The symptoms of stuttering and eye twitching completely stopped without any special treatment after one week.
In this case, the cause of stuttering and eye twitching may be linked to pregabalin.
Clinicians should be alert to the rare symptoms linked with pregabalin use.
