Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

The aim of this study was to investigate the terms used to refer to cognitive (memory-related) and fatigue related side effects. Additionally, the study aimed to understand the terms' prevalence or frequency in phase III add-on clinical trials of anti-epileptic - or antiseizure - drugs (AEDs).
The authors extracted data from publicly available Food and Drug Administration of the United States (FDA) documents as well as the published literature.
Target drug doses were then calculated as drug loads and divided into three categories (low, average, high).
Odds ratio, or the measure of association between drug intake and side effect development, were calculated for each drug load. The presence of a dose-response effect, or when side effects increase when drug dose increases, was also assessed (measured).
The authors found that the cognitive terms used across trials were very variable (all over the place). Data on discontinuation rates (stoppings in side effects) were limited.
Placebo (harmless pills) rates for cognitive side effects ranged from 0 to 10.6% while those for fatigue ranged from 2.5 to 37.7%.
Most of the AEDs exhibited a clear dose-response effect and significant odds ratios for developing side effects at high doses.
Due to their clinical (medical) relevance and impact on quality of life, new trials should make data related to the prevalence and discontinuation rates of these side effects publicly available.
Due to the clear dose response effect, doctors should consider using lower drug loads and adjusting doses to improve tolerability (or ability to take the drug).
