Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Herpes zoster is an acute, painful, herpes skin disease caused by varicella-zoster virus, which may cause viral meningitis.
Pregabalin has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of pain in patients with herpes zoster.
However, it has the side effects of neurotoxicity.
We describe a 68-year-old female patient with herpes zoster, and she was treated with pregabalin.
The patient presented with stuttering and frequent blepharospasm after 3 days of pregabalin treatment.
Pregabalin was discontinued, the symptoms of stuttering and frequent blepharospasm completely resolved without any special treatment after one week.
In this case, the etiology of stuttering and frequent blepharospasm may be related to pregabalin.
Clinicians should be alert to the rare symptoms associated with the use of pregabalin.
