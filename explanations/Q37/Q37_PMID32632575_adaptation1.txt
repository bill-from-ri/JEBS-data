Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Herpes zoster is an acute, painful, herpes skin disease. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The virus may cause viral meningitis or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.
Pregabalin, a nerve pain medication, has been shown to be effecive in the treatment of pain in patients with herpes zoster.
However, it can cause neurotoxicity or alteration of the normal acitivty of the nervous system (brain and spinal cord).
This study describes a 68-year-old female patient with herpes zoster, and she was treated with pregabalin.
The patient presented with stuttering and frequent, uncontrollable movement of the eyelids after 3 days of pregabalin treatment.
Pregabalin was no longer given to the patient. The symptoms of stuttering and frequent eyelid movement completely resolved without any special treatment after one week.
In this case, the onset of stuttering and frequent eyelid movement may be related to pregabalin.
Clinicians should be alert to the rare symptoms associated with the use of pregabalin.
