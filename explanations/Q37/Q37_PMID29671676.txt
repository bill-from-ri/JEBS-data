Do memory problems improve over time when taking pregabalin?

Aim: Randomized Phase I study examining the effects of gabapentinoids gabapentin, pregabalin and gastroretentive gabapentin on simulated driving performance, sedation and cognitive function in healthy volunteers (n = 32).
Methods: Driving attentiveness, sleepiness and cognition were evaluated prior to subjects receiving study doses.
Blood samples were collected during each treatment.
Results: Subjects receiving gastroretentive gabapentin showed less change in variation in lateral lane position (p = 0.0275), less tremor (p = 0.0304) and fewer vision disturbances compared with gabapentin (p = 0.0177).
Statistically significant decrease in One Card Learning Test performance was observed after treatment with gastroretentive gabapentin.
Conclusion: Gastroretentive gabapentin demonstrated reduced driving impairment and lower scores on key neurotoxicity measures.
Further studies in patients with postherpetic neuralgia are needed.
