Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

Our aim is to find what could cause wrong COVID-19 test results.
Blood of 200 patients without COVID-19 infection was tested for proteins that protect against COVID-19 virus. 100 of the patients were healthy, the others had proteins that could attack their own bodies or proteins associated with pregnancy, 50 each.
Pregnant women had more of the common anti-COVID protein, but all other groups had the same amounts. 
There was more anti-COVID protein the body makes when it fights a new infection in pregnant women, normal seniors, and people with proteins that attack their own body. These groups had significantly more false positive COVID test results. 
Some of the false positive tests caused by the protein that attack your own body can be turned into true negative by adding a chemical called urea to the test. 
False positive test results could be caused by pregnancy, old age and proteins that attack your own body.
