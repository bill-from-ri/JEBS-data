Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

COVID-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic.
Quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends some tests that detect COVID-19 virus.
But we do not know how accurate these tests are.
This study estimates accuracy of three commercial rapid tests in a clinical setting in Ethiopia
From April to June 2021 we got 279 nasal swabs from community testing, contact cases and suspected cases.




Among the 279 respiratory samples, 50, 59, and 69 tested positive by the three tests.
The tests agreed ranging from moderate to strong agreement. 
The tests accurately recognized people that did not have COVID (91 to 99 out of 100), but had more mistakes identifying people who had COVID, only 81 to 83 out of 100 sick people were found.
All three tests were almost equal in identifying people with COVID-19, but one test was worse than the other two in identifying people without the disease.
