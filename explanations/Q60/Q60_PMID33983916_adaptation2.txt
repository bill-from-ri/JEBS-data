Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

Fast and accurate COVID-19 tests help reduce the spread of the disease, including in hospitals.
Some of the known tests are expensive, take a long time and need training to do the test. 
Other tests are fast and easy to do without training. 
Accuracy of the easier and faster tests compared to the traditional tests is an area of interest.
The Quidel rapid test was approved for emergency use in patients within the first 5 days of COVID-19 symptoms.
These tests agreed with the traditional test for 83 to 99 out of 100 patients with positive results and 97 to all 100 patients with negative results.
For the COVID-19 patients that did not have symptoms, the tests were not as accurate as the traditional test.
We compared test results at a hospital in June - August 2020.
Among 1,732 patients that had no symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on about 60 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests.
Among 307 patients that had symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on over 70 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests.
As rapid test misses many COVID-19 cases, traditional tests might be needed when the disease is on the rise. False negative test results cause delays in quarantine and treatment of COVID-19.
