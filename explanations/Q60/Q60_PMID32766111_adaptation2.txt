Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

A 72-year-old man has a confirmed human coronavirus HKU1 pneumonia.
His nasal swab test for COVID-19 virus was negative twice, but his antibody (chemicals the body produces to fight the virus) test was positive.
We then did the antibody test on the stored blood of other patients who had confirmed viral infections, such as flu and common cold, before January 2019.
Including the present case, four of 7 antibody test results were falsely positive for COVID-19.


The high rate of the falsely positive antibody test results might be due to similarities between the human common cold coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.
The results of the antibody tests may depend on epidemics of human common cold coronavirus infection.
The spread of the past SARS-CoV-2 infections may be overestimated because of the falsely positive antibody test results.
