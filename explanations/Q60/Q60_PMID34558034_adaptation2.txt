Can a covid test results be a false positive if your just getting over a cold and allergies?

Repeated positive COVID-19 tests show that the risk of new people getting the disease is growing.
We studied what causes positive test results. 
We studied children with COVID-19 who were at the hospital in February - March 2020.
133 children had negative rpeated COVID-19 test results and 51 had positive results.
Among patients with repeated positive tests, there were more with cough and fewer with shortness of breath, compared to patients with the negative test.
Patients who had symptoms and repeated positive tests were admitted to the hospital and had positive test results earlier. 
People who had repeated positive tests also had different blood test results compared to the people with negative tests.

Coughing and a certain blood test result were each associated with a positive retest result.
Patients who stayed at the hospital for less than 2 weeks or had symptoms shortly after getting COVID-19 should be quarantined.
These results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.
