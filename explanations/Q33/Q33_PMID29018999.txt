How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

The objective of this study was to perform population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of gabapentin in healthy Korean subjects and to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms (1236C > T, 2677G > T/A, and 3435C > T) of ABCB1 gene on PK parameters of gabapentin.
Data were collected from bioequivalence studies, in which 173 subjects orally received three different doses of gabapentin (300, 400, and 800 mg).
Only data from reference formulation were used.
Population pharmacokinetics (PKs) of gabapentin was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM).
Gabapentin showed considerable inter-individual variability (from 5.2- to 8.7-fold) in PK parameters.
Serum concentration of gabapentin was well fitted by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time.
An inhibitory Emax model was applied to describe the effect of dose on bioavailability.
The oral clearance was estimated to be 11.1 L/h.
The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L.
The absorption rate constant was estimated at 0.860 h-1, and the lag time was predicted at 0.311 h.
Oral bioavailability was estimated to be 68.8% at dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at dose of 800 mg.
The creatinine clearance significantly influenced on the oral clearance (P < 0.005) and ABCB1 2677G > T/A genotypes significantly influenced on the absorption rate constant (P < 0.05) of gabapentin.
However, ABCB1 1236C > T and 3435C > T genotypes showed no significant effect on gabapentin PK parameters.
The results of the present study indicate that the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is decreased when its dosage is increased.
In addition, ABCB1 2677G > T/A polymorphism can explain the substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of gabapentin.
