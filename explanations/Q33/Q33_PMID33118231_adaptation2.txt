How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin (GBP), an antiseizure drug, can treat neuropathic or nerve-related pain, including diabetic neuropathic pain.
We evaluate the role of diabetes and blood sugar control on drug activity in the GBP population.
A trial was done in 29 patients with neuropathic pain, 19 from type 2 diabetes and 10 from lower back/neck disc herniation or bulging.
All participants swallowed a single dose of GBP.
Blood was taken up to 24 hours after GBP treatment.




Measurements for lag time, absorption rate, volume of distribution, and clearance rate were 0.316 h (10.6%), 1.12 h-1 (10.7%), 140 L (7.7%) and 14.7 L/h (6.97%), respectively.
No link was seen with high blood sugar, blood sugar levels, diabetes diagnosis, age, sex, weight, body mass index, or certain DNA sequences.
This model measuring drug activity accurately estimated GBP concentrations in those with neuropathic pain, using kidney drug filtration rate for total drug clearance.
The distribution and removal processes of GBP were not affected by high blood sugar or diabetes.
