How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin is a nerve-related pain drug, which in humans is cleared from the body solely by the kidneys and is not attached to proteins in plasma (the liquid part of blood).
Because the clearance of gabapentin depends on the kidneys, how the body processes gabapentin is investigated in patients who do not make enough urine and who are on dialysis, a process of cleaning the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally.
Plasma samples are collected over an 8-day period after a single oral (by mouth) dose of gabapentin is given.
Plasma samples before and after being filtered, as well as dialysis fluid, are collected during dialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after receiving the gabapentin dose.
An average maximum amount of gabapentin in plasma is achieved at 4.7 hours after the dose.
The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half on non-dialysis days averages 132 hours.
About 35% of gabapentin dose is recovered in dialysis fluid, and the average clearance of gabapentin in dialysis was 142 milliliters per minute.
The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half during dialysis is about 4 hours.
Gabapentin concentrations in the plasma increased about 30% during the first 2 hours after dialysis as a result of the drug being sent to other parts of the body.
It is recommended that patients with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis receive a starting 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin dose.
Plasma gabapentin concentrations can remain stable by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of dialysis.
