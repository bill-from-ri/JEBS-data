How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Drug activity data of gabapentin (GBP) in community-dwelling elderly patients show a great effect of advanced age on GVP drug activity due to altered kidney function.
However, there are no data in elderly nursing home (NH) patients to measure gabapentin absorption and elimination.
We characterize the drug activity of GBP in elderly nursing home patients that are on GBP therapy.
This is a drug actvity study in elderly nursing home patients (â‰¥60 years) given GBP for long-term pain or epilepsy (brain disorder causing seizures) from seven nursing homes.

A mathematical model showed the data and clearance (CL) was linked with estimated kidney filtration rate.
The GBP clearance in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 liters/hour.
After adjusting for kidney filtration, GBP clearance was not affected by age, sex, body weight, or associated diseases.
No effects of body size, age, and sex were detected on amount of distribution.
Functional or active GBP amount is linked to dose amount.
Analysis suggests certain mathematical models successfully tracked the trend and variation in gabapentin amount over time.
In this analysis, certain measures seem similar between elderly and young adults.
