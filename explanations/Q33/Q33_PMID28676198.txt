How long does it take for gabapentin to go out of the body?

Gabapentin is almost exclusively cleared by the kidney and thus presents challenges in patients with kidney failure.
Gabapentin is known to be effectively cleared by hemodialysis, but the efficiency of clearance by peritoneal dialysis (PD) has not been previously described.
We report a case of gabapentin toxicity in a patient on long-term PD who was treated with continuous automated cycling PD.
We find that continuous PD provides significant clearance of gabapentin.
With 2-L exchanges every 2 hours, we document an apparent elimination half-life of 41.33 hours, which is substantially shorter than the reported elimination half-life of 132 hours in the absence of kidney function.
Further, our patient's symptoms of gabapentin toxicity gradually improved and had fully resolved after about 36 hours of dialysis.
Gabapentin clearance by PD was estimated at 94% of urea clearance.
We conclude that intensive PD provides gabapentin clearance that approximates that of urea and is an effective but slow method to treat gabapentin overdose and toxicity.
