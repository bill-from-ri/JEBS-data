Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

The background of this study is that iron is a necessary element to almost all living beings. The delicate balance between host immune system and viral growth plays an important role in infections.
The link between iron metabolism and recovery from COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) remains poorly understood.
We aimed to estimate the links between full-body iron metabolism with the severity and risks of side effects in COVID-19.
In this clinical study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020).
Basic background data, other diseases, lab tests, treatments, and clinical results were all collected.
A specific mathematical test was used to estimate the links between iron levels with the severity and risks of side effects in COVID-19 patients.
As a result, we identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients.
The average age was 63 years, and the average length of hospital stay was 28 days.
After adjusting for age, sex, immune signals, and pre-existing diseases, all iron measures were linked with the severity of COVID-19 for blood iron and iron-containing proteins.
These iron measures were also linked to the risk of a serious lung condition that leads to low blood oxygen, excessive bleeding or clotting, immediate heart-related injury, immediate liver injury, and immediate kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high immune signal levels.
In conclusion, patients with low blood iron likely suffered from severe effects of and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19.
The iron metabolism measures might be risk factors and clinical markers for COVID-19 recovery.
