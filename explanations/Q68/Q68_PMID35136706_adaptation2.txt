Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

The importance of ferritin (an iron-containing protein) as an inflammatory marker is well known.
However, it is unknown whether this differs between Covid-19 (a viral lung infection) and non-Covid-19 patients.
The blood levels of ferritin, white blood cells (WBC - specific immune cells), C-reactive protein (CRP - a marker of inflammation), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; an enzyme that helps make energy) may all be measured to check whether there is a difference.
The researchers want to see if the inflammatory process changes between these two kinds.
Blood samples were collected from 119 COVID-19 patients in the hospital and 50 healthy persons.
Corona virus (which causes COVID-19) was discovered when a nose swab was collected and tested for fragments of the virus.
Ferritin, LDH, WBC, and CRP were also tested in that sequence.
The study revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher levels of ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH in their blood than healthy people.
From the existing data, males are more likely to be infected with COVID-19 (81%) than females (32%). Females had greater ferritin, CRP, WBC, and LDH levels than males.
Because they are related to a test for predicting COVID-19 infection, the recommended cut-off values for ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH are 109.8 ng/mL, 14.9109/L, 10.15 mg/L, and 229.33 U/L, respectively.
Finally, an increase in ferritin levels in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 is linked to an increase in inflammatory markers including CRP, WBC, and LDH. This understanding  may assist in the identification of COVID-19 infection.
