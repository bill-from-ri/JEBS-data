Why is transferrin and iron low in covid patients but ferritin high?

During infections, the human moves around iron in order to starve disease-causing molecules (pathogens) from this nutrient.
Several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage.
Ferritin is the most important iron storage protein.
It is made up of different amounts of two proteins, the L- and H-ferritins (FTL and FTH).
We previously showed that macrophages (specific immune cells) increase their amount of FTH1 when they are infected as cells in a test tube with Mycobacterium avium (bacteria related to tuberculosis), without a significant increase in FTL.
In this work, we tested the role of macrophage FTH1 in M. avium infection as cells in a living organism.
We found that mice low in FTH1 in myeloid cells (specific bone marrow cells) are more resistant to M. avium infection. They have lower bacterial amounts and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (infection signaling molecules) than normal mice, due to the lower levels of available iron in their bodies.
Importantly, we also found that FTH1 made by myeloid cells due to infection may be found in blood and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution.
Specifically, without FTH1 in myeloid cells, increased amounts of ferroportin (iron-transporting proteins) is observed in liver granulomas (small areas of inflammation) and increased iron storage occurs in liver cells.
These results show the importance of FTH1 in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection.
