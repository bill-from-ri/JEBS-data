How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

This study aims to monitor the amount of coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - the breathing-related illness) in the blood, also called viral load, and the specific, infection-fighting proteins used by the immune system, called antibodies, among patients with coronavirus and healthy travelers who have the virus but no symptoms.
Samples from 57 hospitalized Covid-19 patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers (people who have the virus but no symptoms) are tested.

Among seriously ill Covid-19 patients, there is a higher viral load in the throat, sputum (lung), and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms start.
Among carriers with no symptoms, the viral load is found to stay for a shorter time period (1-8 days) in the throat and in the digestive system.
Antibodies to fight the viruses responded in 51.4% of confirmed patients and 62.6% among asymptomatic people within 66 days from symptom starting.
The average time between the start of symptoms and positive (or detected) antibodies is 30 days for the IgG antibody, and 23 days for the IgM antibodies, which often suggest a recent infection.
Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers within 2 weeks, and the positive result among them for the IgG and IgM antibodies is 12.8%.
The IgM/IgG antibodies confirmed 3 suspected coronavirus cases, even though they tested negative for coronavirus using another test.
When compared to other viruses that impact the lungs, Covid-19 has fewer asymptotic carriers and has a lower antibody response. Covid-19 also has a longer period of time developing antibodies in recovered patients.
These findings highlight how complex transmission or spread is in Covid-19.
