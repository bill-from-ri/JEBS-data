How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

In the current Covid-19 pandemic, one possible cause for concern is that some Covid-19 patients sent home from the hospital are testing positive again for (or have) coronavirus, which causes the respiratory lung infection of Covid-19.
To better understand what is happening and provide timely information to officials and doctors, researchers searched and reviewed completed studies about patients discharged or released from the hospital who test positive again for the coronavirus.
The search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China.
The review of these reports suggests the presence of discharged patients who do not have any symptoms but test positive.
However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive test for genetic traces of the virus does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus.
The review suggests the need for testing different samples at the same time, including, for example, fecal (poop) samples, from Covid-19 patients before and after they are sent home from hospitals.
