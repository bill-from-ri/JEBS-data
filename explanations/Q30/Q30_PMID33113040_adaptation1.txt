How long will you be positive for covid after illness?

Many studies have shown that testing positive again for (or having) coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients (patients recovered from the serious viral, lung infection of Covid-19) is very common.
This study aims to summarize medical and other key characteristics of these patients. The summary will discuss explanations for the return of the virus in recovered patients, how contagious people are after they have recovered from the virus but test positive again, and the care of Covid-19 patients after going home from the hospital.
The percentage who re-tested as positive in discharged Covid-19 patients is between 2.4 to 69.2%. Retesting as positive continued from 1 to 38 days after discharge, or release, from the hospital, depending on population size, age, and the type of samples used to test.
Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients are suggested, including incorrect negative or positive test results; reactivation (when someone appears to have recovered but still has traces of the virus in the body); and being re-infected with coronavirus, but the process leading to these re-positive tests is still unclear.
Preventing patients who have recovered and are sent home from testing positive again is an important step to control the spread of the pandemic.
To limit the number of false-negatives tests (when a person tests negative but are actually positive for the virus) before being sent home, study researchers suggest doing more than 2 tests.
In addition, samples should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify coronavirus DNA before discharge from the hospital.
More studies should be done to develop new tests that target a crucial part of the genes from the virus in order to improve its accuracy.
