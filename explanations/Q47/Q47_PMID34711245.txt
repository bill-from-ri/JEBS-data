What causes low alkaline phosphate levels?

Background: Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) encoded by the ALPL gene is of particular importance for bone mineralization.
Mutation in the ALPL gene can lead to persistent low ALP activity resulting in the rare disease Hypophosphatasia (HPP) that is characterized by disturbed bone and dental mineralization.
While severe forms are extremely rare with an estimated prevalence of 1/100.000, recent studies suggest that moderate form caused by heterozygous mutations are much more frequent with an estimated prevalence of 1/508.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low AP levels in the population based on laboratory measurements.
Methods: In this study, the prevalence of low AP activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels was analyzed in 6.918.126 measurements from 2011 to 2016 at a single laboratory in northern Germany.
Only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included.
Only the first measurement was included, all repeated values were excluded.
Results: In total, 8.46% of the measurements of a total of 6.918.126 values showed a value < 30 U/L. 0.59% of the subjects with an ALP activity below 30 U/L had an additional PLP measurement.
Here, 6.09% showed elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels.
This suggest that 0.52% (1:194) of subjects show laboratory signs of HPP.
Conclusion: These data support the genetic estimation that the prevalence of moderate forms of HPP may be significantly higher than expected.
Based on these data, we recommend automatically measurement of PLP in the case of low ALP activity and a notification to the ordering physician that HPP should be included in the differential diagnosis and further exploration is recommended.
