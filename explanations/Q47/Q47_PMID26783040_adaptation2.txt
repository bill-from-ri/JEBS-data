What causes low alkaline phosphate levels?

Low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a protein that influences the high-energy molecule phosphate, indicates low blood phosphate levels.
However, the importance and genetics of low ALP in random groups is unknown.
To clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals with unexplained low ALP levels.
Nine had mildly high blood phosphate levels. Three had mildly high blood calcium levels.
ALP levels trended oppositely with blood calcium, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6, and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), a key molecule to build cell boundaries.
Although many had minor complains, like mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems.
Gene sequence changes in ALPL, the gene encoding ALP, were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six new changes.

Mutations that change a protein segment were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%). The majority were predicted to have a harmful effect on protein activity.
Having a mutated gene was linked with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of blood ALP, higher levels of PLP and PEA, and mildly higher blood phosphate.
Ten people had above-average PLP levels. All had a mutated gene.
Half of the adults with unexplained low blood ALP had an ALPL mutation.
Although the associated physical symptoms are usually mild, in around 50% of the cases, protein enzyme activity is low enough to cause phosphate accumulation and may predispose to defects in high-calcium body parts.
