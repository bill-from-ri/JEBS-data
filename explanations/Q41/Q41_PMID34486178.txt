What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited renal disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively.
Downregulation or overexpression of PKD1 or PKD2 in mouse models results in renal cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis.
Here we show that enhanced PC2 expression is a common feature of PKD1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA.
However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2.
We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones.
GRP94 was found to physically interact with PC2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of GRP94 led to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone.
Moreover, GRP94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known deacetylase and activator of HSP90 proteins.
Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC2 suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels.
Lastly, we showed that inhibition of GRP94 prevents cAMP-induced cyst formation in vitro.
Taken together our data uncovered a novel HDAC6-GRP94-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.
