What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disorder of abnormal kidney cell growth and development of many fluid-filled cysts or swellings in the kidneys.
Before, we showed there is increased signaling of a specific cell pathway (Notch) compared to normal kidney cells. This Notch signaling contributes to cystic cell growth.
Quinomycin A, a specific protein segment, has been shown to target the Notch cell signaling pathway and block tumor growth in cancer.
Here, we show that Quinomycin A decreased cell and cyst growth of human, diseased cyst cells created in an isolated environment.
Treatment with Quinomycin A reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and reduced kidney cystic area and scarred tissue in mice with PKD.
Reduced amounts of proteins of the Notch cell signaling patway, RBPjk and HeyL, and reduced cell growth in kidneys of PKD mice also occured with the other effects.
Quinomycin A also controlled hairlike structions on cyst cells from kidney tubes.
This is the first study to show that Quinomycin A blocks PDK progression and suggests that Quinomycin A has beneficial value for PKD patients.
