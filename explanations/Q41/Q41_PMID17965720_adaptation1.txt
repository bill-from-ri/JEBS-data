What could possibly cause a cyst in the lower pole of the kidney?

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disease that causes many cysts (growths) usually in the kidneys, and is an important cause of end-stage kidney disease, for which there is no proven therapy.
Changes in the PKD1 gene (which creates an active kidney protein) are the main causes of this disease.
The disease begins before birth and develops slowly, but it is not known whether the development and growth of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life.
When the Pkd1 gene is not active in mice within 13 days after birth, this results in many cysts in the kidneys within 3 weeks. However, inactivation (turning off) of Pkd1 at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 5 months.
Researchers find that cell growth and development is not higher in samples of cysts than in comparison groups. However, the sudden change of Pkd1 becoming inactive matched a stopping point of kidney growth that is not previously recognized and matched significant changes in how the gene functions.
These findings suggest that the effects of inactivating the Pkd1 gene are like a switch that signals the end of the end-stage kidney process.
These studies show that Pkd1 regulates changes in both developing kidneys and in adult kidneys, but the process of inactivation are defined by the stage of the organ's development.
These results have important connections to the understanding of the disease and treatment approaches.
