Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

This study aimed to evaluate different tools used in compression therapy and assess (measure) how they work.
The levels of pressure and stiffness of the compression devices, alone or in combination with other materials, can be measured on living organisms.
Hemodynamic (blood flow) effects have been demonstrated by measuring venous (vein) volume and flow velocity using several testing methods. Venous reflux (reverse flow) and venous pumping function have been demonstrated using bodily fluid volume and pressure measurements.
Oedema (swelling) reduction can be measured by limb volumetry, a method of suspending a limb in water to determine the amount of water displaced.
Compression stockings putting pressure on the lower leg are able to increase venous blood flow velocity while patients are lying down. Compression stockings are also able to prevent leg swelling after prolonged sitting and standing.
In the upright position, specific pressure (>50 mmHg) is needed for intermittent (irregular) closing of abnormal veins and for pressure reduction during walking.
High, intermittent pressure peaks exerting a "massaging effect" may be achieved by short stretch multilayer bandages instead of elastic stockings.
Compression is important in the management of not fully functioning venous and lymphatic systems.
However, using compression as a treatment is still underestimated. Compression deserves better understanding and improved educational programs for both patients and medical staff.
