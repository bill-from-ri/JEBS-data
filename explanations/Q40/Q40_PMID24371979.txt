Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Compression therapy is the basic therapy in phlebology and lymphology.
The pressure under the bandages has to exceed the intravenous pressure especially in standing position.
Different compression materials such as short stretch systems, long stretch bandages and compression garments work differently on ambulatory venous hypertension, speed of reducing edema and arterial flow.
Compression with high stiffness, inelastic materials is more effective than compression with low stiffness, elastic materials.
These materials have to be placed correctly.
Inelastic systems should be applied with high initial pressure because the pressure will loose at some time after walking.
Even after one week of wearing, inelastic bandages keep higher resting and working pressure during walking than elastic bandages.
However, more important is that they have lower resting pressure than elastic materials.
Long stretch bandages and compression garments with great extensibility ensure low working pressure and higher resting pressure than short stretch systems.
