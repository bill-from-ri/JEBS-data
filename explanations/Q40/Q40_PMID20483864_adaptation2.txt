Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

A too high pressure from compression devices is poorly tolerated and may causes skin damage, espeically in those with blocked blood vessels in limbs.
We aim to check if low compression pressure may improve blood vessel pumping in patients with impaired blood vessels.
Blood vessel pumping function was measured in 20 patients with severely impaired blood flow in the body's largest vein.
Measurements were repeated after using knee-high compression socks and inelastic bandages applied with low, medium, and high pressure while lying down.
The amount of blood pumped was compared to healthy patients.
Compression socks exerted an average pressure of 27 mmHg while lying down and slightly higher pressure of 30.5 mmHg while standing. This led to a minor improvement in the amount of blood pumped, or ejection fraction (EF), by 17%.
Inelastic bandages with a pressure of 20.5 mmHg while lying down led to a standing pressure of 36 mmHg, which led to a major increase in EF by 61.5%.
A larger increase of pressure to 40 and 60 mmHg led to an increase in the amount of blood pumped of 91% and 98%, respectively.
In those with impaired blood vessel pumping, inelastic bandages lead to a pressure-dependent increase of EF.
Inelastic bandages even with a pressure of 20 mmHg improved blood vessel pumping.
