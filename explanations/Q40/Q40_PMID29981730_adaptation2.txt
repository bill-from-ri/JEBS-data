Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

This study aimed to find blood flow and tolerance under less-stretchable compression treatment in elderly patients with mixed-cause leg sores or open wounds (leg ulcers).
We studied 25 hospitalized patients with blocked blood vessels in the limbs.
Less-stretchable compression bandages were applied daily.
Ankle pressure, toe blood flow, and oxygen pressure at the skin on the top of the foot was measured at the start and after bandage removal at 24 hours.
Big toe blood flow was measured 10 minutes after applying the bandage.
Compression pressure was measured with a special device at the start, at 10 minutes, and before bandage removal at 24 hours.
Patient tolerance was measured while considering the patient's pain and skin tolerance.
Average age of patients was 80 years.
Average duration of sores or open wounds was 18 months.
High blood pressure was common.
One third of patients had diabetes.
Neither pressure nor oxygen to the toes changed with compression therapy, but compression pressure decreased over 24 hours.
The compression pressure loss was noticeable 10 minutes after applying the bandage.
Nearly all ulcers were painful before compression therapy and needed painkillers.
One patient needed a more powerful pain killer.
No increase in pain or blood-flow-related skin damage occured with compression.
In elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers and sufficient toe pressure, less-stretchable compression does not negatively affect blood flow and appears tolerated.
Bandages with appropriate compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the blood flow part of the disease.
