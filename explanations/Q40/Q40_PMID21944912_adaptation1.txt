Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

This study was conducted to find what bandage pressures are safe and effective in treating leg ulcers (leg sores) caused by various vein disorders.
The study evaluated 25 patients with leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with various pressures (20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg). Several measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation. These measurements included laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo(2)), and toe pressure. LDF measures blood flow. TcPO2 measures oxygen in the skin.
Ejection fraction (EF) of the venous pump, or the blood flowing from the heart, was performed to assess blood flow from the heart every time it contracts.
LDF values under the bandages increased at all three pressure ranges.
At toe level, a significant decrease in flux (blood buildup) was seen when bandage pressure was >41 mm Hg.
Toe pressure values and TcPo(2) moderately increased.
Inelastic bandages were highly efficient in improving venous pumping function. This is when a machine compresses veins to force blood flow to the heart.
The study concluded that patients with mixed ulceration using inelastic compression of up to 40 mm Hg do not experience impeded (blocked) arterial perfusion. Arterial perfusion is when a patient has their blood drawn, has the blood mixed with medication, and has the blood pumped back into the host. However, this inelastic compression may lead to a regularly decreased venous pumping function.
These bandages are recommended in combination with walking exercises as the basic treatment for patients with mixed leg ulcers.
