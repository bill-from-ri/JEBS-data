Could compression therapy with bandage raise your blood pressure?

Venous (gravitational) leg ulcers are unsightly, sometimes painful and often difficult to heal.
They are associated with incompetence of valves in the deep leg veins and venous hypertension.
The main approaches in the management of venous leg ulcers have been to reduce the 'back pressure' in the veins by surgical removal of any varicose veins, postural drainage (elevation of the legs when the patient is lying or seated), and use of compression therapy with bandages, hosiery or intermittent pneumatic compression.
In this article, we review the efficacy and discuss correct use of compression therapy.
