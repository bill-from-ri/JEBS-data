Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

‘Mix-and-match’ boosters against COVID-19 are being studied in UK and Spain using Oxford, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines.
Other combinations of CoronaVac, Janssen, and CanSino are also being tested. 
The ‘mix-and-match’ strategy has been used before to develop body protection against other diseases. 
We will try to understand why this approach might work for COVID-19.
To study the mix-and-match approach, we look at how the different vaccines work, the chemicals in the vaccines and their side effects. 
The mix-and-match strategy is safe, improves body protection and allows to deal with vaccine shortages.
