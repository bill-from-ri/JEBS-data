Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

The three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) work well and fewer vaccinated people get sick. Breakthrough infections still sometimes happen, which means vaccinated people may get sick.
We need data on the use of the same booster and boosters that are different from the primary vaccine in fully vaccinated people.
In this clinical trial, fully vaccinated adults with no reported history of COVID-19 infection got a booster injection at least 12 weeks after the primary vaccination. They got one of the three vaccines: Moderna, Johnson & Johnson-Janssen, or Pfizer.
On trial days 15 and 29 they were checked for booster safety, signs of the body’s response to the vaccine, and ability to build up protection against the COVID-19 virus.
458 people participated in the trial. 154 got Moderna, 150 got Johnson & Johnson, and 153 got Pfizer.
Signs of the body’s response to the booster were similar to the primary vaccine.
More than half had injection-site pain, general discomfort, headache, or muscle aches.
All boosters increased the body's ability to protect itself against the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 4-fold to over 70-fold. The numbers of the antibodies that protect against COVID-19 increased from 5-fold to over 50-fold.
Using the same vaccine for the boosters increased the protection up to 20-fold, but using a different vaccine increased the protection more.
All boosters, except for Johnson & Johnson, increased the body's ability to protect itself agains the spike that the virus uses to get into the body cells. 
The Johnson & Johnson booster increased the number of cells that block the virus spike in people who were vaccinated with Moderna or Pfizer.
All boosters were safe and increased protection against Covid-19 in adults who were fully vaccinated at least 12 weeks earlier.
