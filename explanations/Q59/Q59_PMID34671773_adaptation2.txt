Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

Coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines protect against Covid-19 well, but some vaccinated people may get sick, which is called breakthrough infections.
Boosters with the same Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are approved as an emergency measure for some people.
We evaluated boosters with the same and different vaccines in people who got the emergency Covid-19 vaccination.
In this clinical trial, adults in ten U.S. locations got Moderna, Janssen or Pfizer boosters at least 12 weeks after getting the first vaccine.
We evaluated the vaccine safety and protection against COVID-19 on study days 15 and 29.
Out of 458 people, 154 got Moderna, 150 got Janssen and 153 got Pfizer boosters.
Adverse reactions to the booster were similar to those reported for the first vaccine. 
More than half of the participants had pain at the injection site, overall weakness, headache, and muscle pains.
Boosters with the same and different vaccines increased protection against the virus. The increase in protection after a different booster was higher.

Boosters with the same and different vaccines were well-tolerated and increased protection against COVID-19 in adults who had the first vaccine at least 12 weeks earlier.
