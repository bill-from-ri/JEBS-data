Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

Getting a Pfizer or Moderna booster after the AstraZeneca vaccine protects against COVID-19 better than getting the same AstraZeneca booster.
We studied how a booster with the same AstraZeneca or a different Pfizer or Moderna vaccine protects against COVID-19 over time.
We analyzed chemicals that protect against COVID-19 in the blood of 57 people on the day of the second vaccination and the following seven days.
All boosters increased the protective chemicals in the blood. 
Different boosters had earlier and stronger protection than boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine. 
People who had Moderna booster after the first AstraZeneca vaccine had more protective chemicals than those who got Pfizer.
The body produced different protective chemicals at the same time. 

The different boosters were more protective than the same AstraZeneca booster.
