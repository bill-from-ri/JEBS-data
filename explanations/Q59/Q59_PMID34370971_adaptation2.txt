Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

Boosters that are not of the same type as the first COVID-19 vaccine can make global COVID-19 immunization easier.
However, we know that getting AstraZeneca and Pfizer 4 weeks apart causes more side effects than getting the same vaccine.
We report the safety and protective strength of different ways to combine AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.

Healthy adults aged 50 years and older that did not have COVID-19 participated in a clinical trial.
Most participants got two doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer or a combination of Pfizer/AstraZeneca or AstraZeneca/Pfizer 28 or 84 days apart.
100 of the participants that had the vaccines 28 days apart was checked for the protective chemicals in the blood more often.
Participants did not know which vaccines they got.  
28 days after boost, chemicals that fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus were measured in patients' blood.
Different-vaccine boosters were considered to be as good as the same-vaccine if the increase in the protective chemicals after the booster was the same or higher for the different vaccines. 
Protection against COVID-19 was measured in all participants.
Safety of the vaccine was measured among participants that had at least one dose of the vaccine. 

For 463 participants with 28 days between the first vaccine and the booster, the results are reported here.
The participants were 54 to 65 years old. About half (212) were women and a quarter (117) were from ethnic minorities.
28 days after the booster, in people who got boosted with Pfizer after AstraZeneca, protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not worse than in those who got the same AstraZeneca booster.
Boosting with AstraZeneca after Pfizer was not as good as getting the second dose of the same Pfizer vaccine. 
Four people had serious health problems during the trial. The problems were not related to getting the vaccines. 
Although getting AstraZeneca after Pfizer was not as good as getting only Pfizer or Pfizer after AstraZeneca, there were still more protective chemicals against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood compared to getting only AstraZeneca. Getting only AstraZeneca is known to protect against COVID-19 and hospitalization.
This trial supports using boosters that are not the same as the first COVID-19 vaccine.
