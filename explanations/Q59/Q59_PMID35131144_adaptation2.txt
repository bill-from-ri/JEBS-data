Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

In Spain, 1.5 million essential workers under 60 years of age got a first AstraZeneca vaccine dose.
Although this vaccine was associated with blood clots and reduction in blood cells, the European Medicines Agency recommended two doses of AstraZeneca for all ages. 
Spain decided not to give the second dose of this vaccine to people under 60 years old.
The government sponsored a clinical trial to evaluate if a dose of Pfizer vaccine works in adults who first got the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The positive results supported giving the Pfizer vaccine as the booster.
Some local authorities decided to follow the recommendation that an AstraZeneca booster should be given.
Because of these contradictions, the Spanish Health Ministry requested those who decide to get the AstraZeneca booster and decline Pfizer should sign an informed consent form. 
Later these essential workers could choose the vaccine but still sign an informed consent form.
Relevant information was posted on the web and given to people at vaccination sites.
Three quarters of people getting the vaccine chose AstraZeneca; maybe because they trusted the European Medicines Agency more. 

Giving people a choice may make future COVID-19 boosters more successful.
