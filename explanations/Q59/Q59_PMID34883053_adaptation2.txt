Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

It is important to have flexibility in using different COVID-19 vaccines for additional doses. We studied mixing AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, which work differently.
In this clinical trial, adults aged 50 years and older who received the first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine got a second dose of the same vaccine or Moderna or Novavax 8-12 weeks after the first dose.
28 days after the second dose, chemicals the body produces to protect itself against COVID-19 were measured in the blood.
These people did not have these chemicals before the study. 
We also studied safety of the vaccines. 

1072 people participated in the study 9.4 weeks after getting the first vaccine. 540 people got the first dose of AstraZeneca and 532 got Pfizer. There were somewhat more men than women in both groups.
28 days after the boosters, all people who had the first AstraZeneca vaccine had an increased number of chemicals against COVID-19 in their blood for all boosters.
In people who had the Pfizer vaccine first, getting a Pfizer or Moderna booster increased the chemicals the most. Novavax also increased the amount of anti-COVID-19 chemicals, but not as much as the other boosters.
15 people had serious problems, but the problems were not caused by the vaccine.
Getting a Moderna dose after AstraZeneca or Pfizer first vaccines temporarily increased protection against COVID-19 more than getting the same second vaccine. Novavax did not work the same way.
Many vaccines can be used as the second dose after getting the first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer. This should help distributing vaccines around the world.
