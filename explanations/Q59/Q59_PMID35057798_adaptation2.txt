Had pfizer covid vac. Should i get moderna booster?

We studied how the immune system responds to Pfizer or Moderna booster after AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination. We compared these cross-vaccine boosters to using the same boosters as the original vaccine: AstraZeneca or Pfizer.
We tested the blood of 59 vaccinated people for its ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus  and for the  chemicals the body produced to fight the virus.
The blood was tested before and after the booster vaccine was given. 


After the first vaccine, chemicals against the parts of the virus that damage human cells ranged from 55-95% for AstraZeneca to 100% for Pfizer.
After the boosters, the blood developed highly effective chemicals that block the parts of the virus that damage human cells. 



Vaccination with different boosters caused the blood to produce more anti-COVID-19 chemicals that boosting with the same AstraZeneca vaccine.

Boosting with different vaccines strongly protects against COVID-19 at about the same level as boosting with the same original Pfizer vaccine.
All vaccines caused the blood to develop strong protection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose.
The protection against the delta variant of COVID-19 was not as strong in the 26 people in whom it was measured.
