How to eliminate nocturnal atrial fibrillation?

To treat irregular heart beats, beta-blockers (drugs that reduce blood pressure) are used to regulate heart rate.
However, beta-blockers also prevent irregular heart beats due to the reduction of nerve-related, stimulating activity.
We measured the irregular-heart-beat-preventing effects of a highly specific drug that reduces blood pressure, bisoprolol, in patients with daily paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF), which involves sudden occurences of an irregular or rapid heart beat.
136 patients with typical daily P-AF were employed.
Patients were divided into a group with daily-specific P-AF and a daily and nightly P-AF group. Patients were also divided into a group with single use of bisoprlol and a combined use group with an drug that prevents an irregular heart beat.

For patients with treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was measured.
Five patients (3.7%) stopped bisoprolol due to side effects.
After using a drug that reduces blood pressure, 109 patients (80%) had personal improvement, and 103 pateints (76%) had quality-of-life improvement. Elimination of sudden occurences of an irregular heart beat was measured in 84 patients (62%).
The elimination rate of episodes of P-AF was higher in the daily P-AF group than in the daily and nightly P-AF group.
There was no difference between the group with single use of bisoprolol and the combined use group.
The long-term effect of bisoprolol was seen in 70 of 83 patients (84%).
Bisoprolol helps prevent an irregular heart beat against nerve-related, sudden episodes of an irregular heart beat, improving personal symptoms and eliminating episodes.
