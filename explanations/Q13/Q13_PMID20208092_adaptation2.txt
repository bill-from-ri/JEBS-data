How to eliminate nocturnal atrial fibrillation?

Sleep-wake changes in the frequency of atrial fibrillation (irregular or rapid heart beat) (AF) is explored by using new advances in signal processing.
Once the frequency of the irregular heart beat is estimated and tracked by a mathematical technique, the result is measured to detect and characterize sleep-wake changes.
With mathematical analysis, the results show that short-term changes in the frequency of the irregular heart beat surpass the changes owing to sleep-wake patterns.
With mathematical analysis, sleep-wake changes were found in 13 of 18 ambulatory heart-beat recordings from those with long-lasting frequencies of irregular heart beats.
With mathematical analysis, the highest frequency of an irregular heart beat usually came in the afternoon, while the lowest usually came at late night.
Thus, sleep-wake changes occur in most with long-lasting AF frequency. However, the short-term changes in AF frequency should be examined.
