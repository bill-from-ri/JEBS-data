How to eliminate nocturnal atrial fibrillation?

Sleep-disordered breathing and irregular heart beats are linked.
This study examines irregular heart beat treatment on 6-month home sleep testing data.
Sixty-seven patients (aged 66 to 86, 53% male) with long-lasting atrial fibrillation (irregular or rapid heart beat) were randomly grouped (1:1:1) to three standard treatments for atrial fibrillation.


The presence of moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing [number of breathing interruptions during sleep ≥ 15/h] was 60%.
At 6 months, there was no change in sleep-disordered breathing measurements.
Twenty-five patients (with standard treatments for irregular heart beat) maintained sinus rhythm for 6 months confirmed on implanted heart beat monitors in these patients.
Number of breathing interruptions during sleep fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h.
Sleep-disordered breathing is very present in patients with lasting irregular heart beats.
Recovery of sinus rhythm, and the linked long-term recovery of blood flow, is linked with a noticeable reduction in the number of breathing interruptions during sleep.
These fewer breathing interruptions during sleep imply reversal of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck region, which is key for causing sleep-disordered breathing.
