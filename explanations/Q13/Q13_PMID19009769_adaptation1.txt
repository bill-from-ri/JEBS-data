How to eliminate nocturnal atrial fibrillation?

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) occurs as muscles in the throat relax and the airway narrows or closes, and breathing is momentarily cut off. OSA is associated with different types of cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat occuring when electrical impulses in the heart do not work properly).
Past studies mostly focus on nighttime heartbeats that are too slow (bradyarrhythmias) or too fast (tachyarrhythmias).
Recent studies document very common occurrences of atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots in the heart) and their association with obesity and other risk factors for atrial fibrillation.
In addition, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device to help people with OSA breathe more easily while sleeping, prevent atrial fibrillation from returning after cardioversion (a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm).
For people with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, the highest risk for sudden death is at night.
This observation suggests that hypoxia (not enough oxygen in the tissues for the body to function properly) or other nighttime abnormalities trigger sudden death.
An important recent finding is the beneficial impact of CPAP on sudden death.
The role of pacing (controlling the heartbeat) in patients with OSA remains controversial.
In general, using a pacemaker (a small device that's placed or implanted in the chest to help control the heartbeat) is not recommended in patients with nighttime heart rate that is too slow (bradyarrhythmias).
However, some researchers recommend pacing in people with severe nighttime bradyarrhythmias who are not able to use or are not responding to CPAP.
According to a recent study, 59% of patients with a permanent pacemaker have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA).
