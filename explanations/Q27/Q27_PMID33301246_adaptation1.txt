How safe is the covid vaccine?

The coronavirus and the resulting Covid-19 disease (a viral, breathing-related disease) has impacted tens of millions of people around the world.
Vaccines that are safe and work well are urgently needed.
In a clinical study that is in progress, people who are at least 16 years old are randomly placed in a group to receive two doses of either a placebo (a shot that does not have medicine) or the BNT162b2 vaccine.
The BNT162b2 vaccine works by increasing proteins that help the immune system.
The main study outcomes are how well the vaccine works against Covid-19 and its safety.
A total of 43,548 participants are randomly put into two groups. Among this group, 43,448 received shots: 21,720 with the BNT162b2 vaccine and 21,728 with the placebo.
Among people who received the BNT162b2 vaccine, 8 got Covid-19 at least 7 days after they received the second dose. Among people who received the placebo, 162 got Covid-19. The BNT162b2 vaccine was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19.
Similar results are observed across smaller groups of participants when looking at age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, and the presence of other conditions.
Among 10 cases of serious Covid-19 starting after the first dose, 9 cases happened in people who received the placebo and 1 in someone who received the BNT162b2 vaccine.
The safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine is described as having short-term, mild-to-moderate pain on the arm where the shot was given, tiredness, and a headache.
The number of serious side effects is low and is similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.
In conclusion, receiving two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine provided 95% protection against Covid-19 in people 16 years or older.
Safety over an average of 2 months is similar to those of other vaccines.
