How safe is the covid vaccine?

There have been reports of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) following vaccination of COVID-19 (a viral respiratory disease).
We checked all hospitalized military people in the Isareli Defense Forces during the COVID-19 vaccination operation (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for diagnosed myocarditis.
We found 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
One case of myocarditis identified 10 days after the second vaccine dose was not included.
These 8 cases were all the events of myocarditis diagnosed in military people during this time period.
All patients were young and generally healthy.
All had mild disease with no consequences.
The frequency of myocarditis in the week after a second vaccine dose was 5.07/100,000 people vaccinated.
Due to the nature of this report, no causality could be identified.
Clinicians should know about the possibility of myocarditis after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination.
True frequency rates should be further investigated.
