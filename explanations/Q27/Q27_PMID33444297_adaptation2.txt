How safe is the covid vaccine?

As of January 3, 2021, the United States has reported 20,346,372 cases of a breathing-related illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and 349,246 related deaths.
Long-term consequences of COVID-19 over a lifetime are unknown. However, COVID-19 survivors, including those who initially had a mild, sudden illness, report persistent symptoms and serious issues.
On December 11, 20202, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approval for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, given as 2 doses separated by 21 days.
On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of health experts, gave an temporary recommendation for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (1). Initial doses were recommended for health care workers and long-term care residents (2).
As of December 23, 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been given in the United States. After people received the vaccine, reports of 4,393 (0.2%) unfortunate events were submitted to an official vaccine event tracking system.
Among the unfortunate events, 175 individual patient reports were picked for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including life-threatening reactions.
Anaplylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination, usually starting within minutes to hours (3).
Twenty-one cases were identified as anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses given). These includ 17 in those with a noted history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had anaphylaxis before.
The average interval from receiving the vaccine to experiencing symptoms was 13 minutes (ranging from 2 to 150 minutes).
Among 20 people with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been sent home.
Of the other case reports determined to not be anaphylaxis, 86 were noted to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions. 61 were considered nonallergic unfortunate events.
Seven individual patient reports were still under investigation.
This report summarizes the clinical and social characteristics of individual patient reports of alltergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis reactions, after receiving the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during December 14-23, 2020 in the United States.
The nation's health protection agency issued new clinical considerations for using mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently allowed in the United States (4) and for preparaing for possibly managing analphylaxis (5).
Along with testing for eligibility and safety measures before giving COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies to manage anaphylaxis, enforce postvaccination observation periods, and immediately treat those experiencing anaphylaxis sign and symptoms with injections of epinephrine, first-aid medication for anaphylaxis (4, 5).
