How safe is the covid vaccine?

The pandemic of Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has led to the development of new vaccines at an very fast pace.
Since the start of major efforts to promote vaccination, reports of ocular adverse effects, which are side effects that impact the eyes or the face near the eyes, after Covid-19 vaccinations have emerged.
This review summarizes these ocular adverse effects that are possibly associated with Covid-19 vaccines and discusses their medical traits and how to care for these effects.
Ocular adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccinations include weakness or paralysis in the facial muscles, problems with eye movement, blind or blurry spots, distorted vision due to fluid build up in the eye, blood clots in the veins or arteries, inflammation (redness or swelling from fighting an infection) inside the eye, inflammation in the retina of the eye, rapid vision loss from previous diseases, and newly-contracted Graves' Disease, a condition that increases thyroid (metabolism-regulating) hormones and can impact the skin and eyes.
Published studies mainly use existing information from previous cases or isolated reports; these are weak studies in establishing association or cause and effect.
However, the described cases are similar, regarding the impact on the eyes or vision, to the Covid-19 disease itself.
Researchers have a theory that the body's immune response to Covid-19 vaccinations may be involved in the development of the ocular adverse effects that occur after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.
Eye surgeons and doctors should be aware of the possible, although rare, ocular adverse effects that impact the eyes after a Covid-19 vaccine.
