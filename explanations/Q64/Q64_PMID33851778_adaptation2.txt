How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

Brain-related development (neurodevelopment) diseases are increasingly recognized to be caused by new gene mutations (de novo variants) with the use of state-of-the-art gene labeling.
These de novo variants may actually be inherited, which could increase the reapparance risk of disease by >50% and is thought to be an underappreciated cause of neurodevelopment diseases.
Our study aimed to find the amount of inheritance in "de novo" neurodevelopmental diseases.
A total of 237 patients (and parents) with neurodevelopmental diseases carrying apparent de novo disease-causing (pathogenic) or likely pathogenic variants were included.
Gene labeling was performed on parental samples to identify parental gene make-up.
Fourteen parental disease-causing gene types (3.0%) in 11 genes were detected with the amount of gene types ranging from 0.22%-34%.
Three parents showed milder disease-related physical attributes than their offspring with relatively high amounts of gene types (23.33%, 25%, 34% separately).
One reoccuring gene type was identified before birth.
A review of group study on gene inheritance in neurodevelopmental diseases was performed.
Our study highlights that identifying the inherited disease-causing gene types will contribute to improving the accuracy of genetic treatment and before-birth diagnosis for reproductive risks.
