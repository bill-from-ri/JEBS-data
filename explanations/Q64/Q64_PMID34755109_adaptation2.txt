How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

Disease-causing variants in the sodium transporter gene (SCN1A) are amongst the most common genetic causes of childhood epilepsies (a brain disorder leading to seizures).
There is considerable variation in both the types of causative gene types and associated physical effects. A recent increase of the physical effects of SCN1A-related epilepsies now includes an early severe growth and epileptic encephalopathy (epilepsy leading to brain damage) with reduction in growth and a abnormal movement disorder.
We report a female with a growth-related and worsening epileptic-movement-related encephalopathy, distinct and more severe than classic Dravet syndrome (lifelong epilepsy).
Medical diagnostics indicated a inherited gene type of SCN1A.
Whole-body gene labeling found a second inherited, likely disease-causing gene type of SCN1A.
Biophysical measurements of both mutant gene types found gain-of-function effects in both SCN1A products; and a more severe persistent physical effect from the second gene type.
Using mathematical analysis, we show that large persistent electrical activity from sodium in the body causes hyper-excitability in brain neurons, thus linking the severe physical effects to the sodium current dysfunction.
These findings further broaden the spectrum of physical effects of SCN1A linked epilepsies and highlight the importance of testing for inheritance in epileptic encephalopathies.
Detailed biophysical tests and mathematical analysis further highlight the role of gain-of-function gene types in the disease-causing attributes of the most severe physical effects linked with SCN1A.
