How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

As the article's background, the EPIGENE network was created in 2014 by four multi-specialty teams made up of geneticists, neurologists treating young children and neurologists specialized in epileptic seizures (or epilepsy) and brain make-up.
The goal of the network was to group together and improve the identification strategy of genetic epileptic disorders using state-of-the-art gene tagging, in France.
Over the years, five additional centers have joined EPIGENE. The network has been working closely, since 2018, with the French reference center for rare epilepsies (CRÃ©ER).
Since 2014, biannual meetings have created four successive versions of a single-gene epilepsy gene panel (PAGEM), increasing from 68 to 144 genes.
A total of 4035 patient cases with epileptic disorders have been analyzed with an identification accuracy of 31% (n = 1265/4035).
The top 10 epileptic-related genes, SCN1A, KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A, SCN8A, PRRT2, PCDH19, KCNT1, SYNGAP1, and GRIN2A, account for one-sixth of patients and half of the identifications provided by the PAGEM.
In conclusion, these results suggest that a gene-panel approach is an efficient, gold-standard test for the genetic identification of genetic epileptic disorders.
In a near future, French patients with "drug-resistant epilepsies with seizure-onset in the first two-years of life" can benefit from tagging their entire genome, as a secondary genetic screening with the use of the 2025 French Genomic Medicine Plan.
The EPIGENE network has also promoted scientific partnerships on genetic epilepsies within CRÃ©ER.
