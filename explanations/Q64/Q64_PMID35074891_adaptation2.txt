How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

For the study's background, we studied disease-causing types of the brain-located gene called SCN1A, which is the most frequent cause of epileptic seizures or epilepsy.
Physical attributes make up a wide spectrum including the severe childhood epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, epilepsy characterized by drug-resistant seizures, lower intelligence, and high death risk, and the milder genetic epilepsy with fever-like seizures plus (GEFS+), characterized by normal intelligence.
Early identification of a child's risk for developing Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+ is key for giving disease-modifying treatments when available before intelligence impairment come up.
Our objective was to develop and verify a disease prediction model using medical and genetic biomarkers for early identification of SCN1A-related epilepsies.
For the study's methods, it was a multicenter group study comprising data from previous SCN1A-positive Dravet syndrome and GEFS+ patients consistently treated with genetic testing (March 2001-June 2020). Data includes age of seizure start and a newly-developed SCN1A genetic score.
A training group was used to develop multiple disease prediction models that were verified using two independent groups.
The main measure was the accuracy of the model predicting Dravet syndrome versus other GEFS+ phenotypes.
1018 participants were included.
The frequency of Dravet syndrome was 616/743 (83%) in the training group, 147/203 (72%) in test group 1 and 60/72 (83%) in test group 2.
A high SCN1A genetic score - 133.4 versus 52.0 - and young age of start - 6.0 months versus 14.8 months -  were each linked with Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+.
A combined 'SCN1A genetic score and seizure onset' model separated Dravet syndrome from GEFS+ more effectively and outperformed all other models.
Model performance was replicated in both test group 1 and 2.
In short, the prediction model allows measurable estimation at disease start whether a child will develop Dravet syndrome versus GEFS+, helping clinicians with treatment counseling and decisions on early use of specific treatments.
This study provides strong evidence that a combined 'SCN1A genetic score and seizure onset' model identifies Dravet syndrome from other GEFS+ phenotypes.
