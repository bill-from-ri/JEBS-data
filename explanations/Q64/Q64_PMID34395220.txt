How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

Background and purpose: In childhood epilepsy, genetic etiology is increasingly recognized in recent years with the advent of next generation sequencing.
This has broadened the scope of precision medicine in intractable epilepsy, particularly epileptic encephalopathy (EE).
Developmental disorder (DD) is an integral part of childhood uncontrolled epilepsy.
This study was performed to investigate the genetic etiology of childhood epilepsy and DD.
Methods: In this study, 40 children with epilepsy and DD with positive genetic mutation were included retrospectively.
It was done in a tertiary care referral hospital of Bangladesh from January 2019 to December 2020.
Genetic study was done by next generation sequencing.
In all cases electroencephalography, neuroimaging was done and reviewed.
Results: In total, 40 children were enrolled and the average age was 41.4Â±35.850 months with a male predominance (67.5%).
Generalized seizure was the predominant type of seizure.
Regarding the association, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was common.
Seventeen cases had genetically identified early infantile EE and common mutations observed were SCN1A (3), SCN8A (2), SLC1A2 (2), KCNT1 (2), and etc.
Five patients of progressive myoclonic epilepsy were diagnosed and the mutations identified were in KCTD7, MFSD8, and CLN6 genes.
Three cases had mitochondrial gene mutation (MT-ND5, MT-CYB).
Some rare syndromes like Gibbs syndrome, KohlschÃ¼tter-TÃ¶nz syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and cerebral creatine deficiency were diagnosed.
Conclusions: This is the first study from Bangladesh on genetics of epilepsy and DD.
This will help to improve the understanding of genetics epilepsy of this region as well as contribute in administering precision medicine in these patients.
