How is scn1a gene disorder tested?

Background: SCN1 A is one of the most important epilepsy-related genes, with disease-causing variants leading to a range of physical effects with varying disease severity.
Different attributes have been hypothesized to influence SCN1A-related physical effects.
We investigate the presence of rare and more common gene types in epilepsy-related genes as possible influencers of SCN1A-related disease severity.
In the study's methods, 87 patients with SCN1A-related epilepsy were investigated.
Whole-body gene labeling was performed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).
Functional gene types in 422 genes linked with epilepsy and/or brain excitability were checked.
Differences in amounts of gene types between the epilepsy genes and four unrelated gene sets were calculated and compared to the amounts of gene types in the same genes in a specific gene database.
The study results show that excesses of gene types in epilepsy genes were observed in the complete group and in the combined group of mildly and severely affected patients, espeically for gene types with minor gene frequencies of <0.05.
Patients with severe physical effects showed much greater excesses of epilepsy gene types than patients with medium physical effects.
In conclusion, our results show that relatively common gene types in epilepsy genes, which would not necessarily be classified as disease-causing, may play a large role in influencing SCN1A physical effects.
They may influence the physical effects of both severely and mildly affected patients.
Our results may be a first step toward meaningful testing of influencing gene types in regular diagnostics for individual patients, to provide a better estimation of disease severity for newly identified patients.
