Facial pain is nerve pain caused by nerves in the spinal cord and outside the spinal cord and brain.
It can be difficult to treat because pain relieve drugs may stop working.
Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS), surgical stimulation of the nerves, is sometimes used, but it is not known yet when to use it for facial pain. 
We review what is known about treating patients with facial pain using MCS and the outcomes of the treatment.

We found information about 108 patients.
MCS helped almost three quarters of the patients. 
The patients felt their pain was reduced almost to half of the pain they felt before surgery. 
The treatment was more effective in younger patients and those with pain on the side of the face. 
Younger patients were more likely to get MCS implanted devices 
MCS is an effective treatment for facial pain.
Younger patients were more likely to get permanent implanted devices.
