What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of trigeminal nerve root and it leads to demyelination gradually.
It was almost idiopathic and occurred unexpected.
The upper cervical spinal cord contains the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus.
Fibers with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion enter in the upper pons and descend caudally to C2 level.
We experienced a rare patient with facial pain, which was paroxysmal attack with severe pain after a clear event, cervical spinal injury (C2).
So, this case reminds us of a possible cause of trigeminal neuralgia after a trauma of the head and neck.
