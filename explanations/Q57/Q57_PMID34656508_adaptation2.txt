Post-traumatic trigeminal neuralgia (PTTN), also known as anesthesia dolorosa, refers to the pain in the trigeminal nerve, a three-part nerve in the head that provides sensation. PTTN is a crippling pain that has no established treatments, specifically for the pain around the eyes and back teeth. 
We describe how trigeminal nerve pain was treated in a patient who had it due to an old injury to his face. 
We describe surgery and treatment that blocked sensation in the facial nerves around the temples and cheek bones. 
This treatment could be used by dental surgeons who treat patients with facial pain.
We also describe a decision support tool for recognizing and treating PTTN.
