Introduction: The complex nature of facial pain conditions creates a diagnostic challenge which may necessitate specialist referral.
Aim: To identify the case mix presenting to a specialist tertiary care facial pain clinic. 
Methods: A retrospective review of 112 patient records was undertaken.
Trends in provisional diagnoses from referrers and the correlation to diagnoses made following specialist consultation were reviewed.
Results: The most common provisional diagnoses recorded in referral letters were painful temporomandibular disorders, trigeminal neuralgia and persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP).
Over a quarter of referrals did not include a provisional diagnosis.
Following assessment, only one case was not given a definitive diagnosis and no patients were diagnosed with PIFP.
A causative factor was identified in all the initially queried PIFP cases, and painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain was found in multiple patients.
Conclusions: Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain onset coincides with dental treatment or other traumatic events.
PIFP is a rare facial pain diagnosis and may be over-diagnosed by dental and medical practitioners.
It is important to systematically exclude other causes before reaching this diagnosis.
This will facilitate effective treatment, manage patient expectations and potentially reduce unnecessary referrals.
