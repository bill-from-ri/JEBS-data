What is neuropathic pain? i was diagnosed with neuropathic pain after being in a car accident where the airbag was not deployed i had 27 facial fractures, thereby diagnosed with the neuropathic pain

Neural facial pain is caused by the nerves that transmit sensation to the head.
If medicines do not help, surgery may be used. Surgeries relieve compressed nerves (microvascular decompression); or shrink tissues using radio waves (radiofrequency (RF) ablation) or local radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery). Other surgeries prevent the nerve from transmitting signals (percutaneous balloon decompression.)
We discuss using radio waves (RF ablation) to treat chronic facial pain.
We summarize what is known about RF ablation for facial pain, including treatment results and complications.





We summarize the pain relief results, patient satisfaction, quality of life, decrease in the drug use, and how often the pain returns.
Combining two different types of radio wave treatments (continuous radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF))reduced pain the best.  CRF treatment was second best, followed by PRF.
All treatments improved patient satisfaction and quality of life, and decreased drug use and return of the pain.
Common complications of the treatment included facial numbness,  weakness of facial muscles, bruised cheeks, failure to blink when the eye is touched, and dry eyes.


We conclude that radio wave treatment (RF ablation) is efficient in treating patients with facial pain. It also improves quality of life and reduces drug use.
Maximal pain control is achieved using combined CRF and PRF therapy.
Complications of the treatment were not frequent and included facial numbness,  weakness of facial muscles, bruised cheeks, failure to blink when the eye is touched, and dry eyes.
