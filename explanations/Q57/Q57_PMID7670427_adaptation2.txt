After peripheral nerves (the parts of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord) are injured, people often feel discomfort for a long time.
A chemical called Substance P is involved in the process of feeling pain. Lowering the amount of this chemical involved in the transmission of nerve signals lessens pain.
Capsaicin was a good long-term treatment for people who experienced an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal nerve is a large, three-part nerve in the head that provides sensation.  Capsaicin is a chemical that lowers the amount of Substance P  in the body.
Drugs that lower the amount of Substance P  in the body may be used alone or together with other medications to treat traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia (an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve.)
