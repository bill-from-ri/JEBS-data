Traumatic injury to the peripheral nerves often results in persistent discomfort.
Substance P has been implicated as a mediator of pain, and depletion of this neurotransmitter has been shown to reduce pain.
Subjects suffering from traumatic dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve were treated with capsaicin, a substance P depleter with significant long-term effects.
This form of therapy may be used individually or in combination with other pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia.
