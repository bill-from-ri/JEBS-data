Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Level of βhCG (a pregnancy hormone) and the presence of any uterine (womb) mass of hydatidiform mole (a cluster of fluid filled sacs) need a careful review or monitoring. These measures are to prevent metastasis (spreading of the cancer to other organs), provide an early treatment, and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy (therapy to combat cancer).
A 36-year old, pregnant patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) level of 509,921 IU/L. A molar pregnancy is a rare complication where a noncancerous tumor develops in the uterus.
Her lung field was clear. She underwent suction and curettage (S & C) procedure, a process that uses a vacuum to remove a fetus.
However, after six weeks, AA presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding. The patient's βhCG level had decreased to 65,770 IU/L.
An abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass.
Nevertheless, her βhCG continued to decline.
AA was advised to undergo a chemotherapy. The patient refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead.
She opted for an "at own risk" (AOR) discharge with scheduled follow up.
Her condition improved with her βhCG showing a downward trend.
Surprisingly, at six months following S & C, her βhCG improved to 0 IU/L. No mass was detected by ultrasound.
Brucea javanica fruits along with Pereskia bleo Annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy. This idea needs further study.
