Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is generally measured in serum (blood). However, spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan.
The purpose of this study was to understand if urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG.
A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients. Samples were collected from patients of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine (outer-womb) pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7. Sample comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. Hydatidiform mole leads to a cluster of fluid filled sacs from a noncancerous tumor developing in the uterus from a nonviable pregnancy.
Initial analysis of sample urinary/serum hCG showed a wide distribution of values. However, the difference in distribution decreased after sample normalization.
Urinary/serum hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups showed no difference before or after surgery.
Serum measurements tended to be similar to that of urinary/serum hCG levels.
The presented case indicated that urinary/serum hCG did not correspond (were not linked) to serum hCG levels.
Urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted. Because of this, hCG levels in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG.
Data of urinary hCG should be interpreted only after normalization.
The authors recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than normalized urinary hCG levels. This is because the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant following surgery.
