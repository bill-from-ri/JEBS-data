Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Objectives: Level of βhCG and the presence of any uterine mass of hydatidiform mole need a careful review or monitoring in order to prevent metastasis, provide an early treatment and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.
Case presentation: A 36-year old fifth gravida patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) level of 509,921 IU/L.
Her lung field was clear and she underwent suction and curettage (S & C) procedure.
However, after six weeks, AA presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding, although her βhCG level had decreased to 65,770 IU/L.
A trans-abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass (3.0 × 4.4 cm).
Nevertheless, her βhCG continued to show a declining trend (8,426 IU/L).
AA was advised to undergo a chemotherapy but she refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead.
She opted for an "at own risk" (AOR) discharge with scheduled follow up.
Subsequently, her condition improved with her βhCG showing a downward trend.
Surprisingly, at six months post S & C, her βhCG ameliorated to 0 IU/L with no mass detected by ultrasound.
Conclusions: Brucea javanica fruits, Pereskia bleo and Annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy and need further studies.
