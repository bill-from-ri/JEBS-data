Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Family doctors often use quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG - a pregnancy hormone) testing to assess first-trimester bleeding.
It is  anticipated to find a range of normal results for any given week in the first trimester. It is predicted an approximate doubling over 48 hours in a normal pregnancy occurs during the first trimester.
Human chorionic gonadotropin often peaks at about 10 weeksâ€™ gestation before declining and stabilizing.
When HCG levels flatline or fail to rise as expected, we consider that the pregnancy might not be viable.
