Why does bloodwork show decreasing levels of hcg in a pregnant woman?

Family physicians often use quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) testing to assess first-trimester bleeding.
While we anticipate a range of normal results for any given week in the first trimester, we predict an approximate doubling over 48 hours in a normal pregnancy during the first trimester.
Human chorionic gonadotropin tends to peak at about 10 weeksâ€™ gestation before declining and stabilizing.
When HCG levels plateau prematurely or fail to rise as expected, we consider that the pregnancy might not be viable.
