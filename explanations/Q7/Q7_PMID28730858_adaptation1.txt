How is strep throat treated?

Chronic GAS carrier state is defined as the long-term presence of group A strep (GAS) in the throat with no infection or inflammation.
Chronic GAS carriers have a low risk of conditions that result from abnormal functioning of the body's immune system.
Long-term GAS in the throat often causes treatment issues.
In this study, we review the science on treating long-term GAS in children and suggest a way to treat it using computers.
Long-term GAS in the throat is found in 10-20% of school-aged children.
Whether or not GAS in the throat causes infection depends on small organisms in the throat and special qualities of GAS, but many things are not clear.
Treating long-term GAS depends on whether the child is high-risk and might benefit from killing the bacteria or not, when a doctor looking at it and removing fears and concerns about the illness are enough.
Combining antibiotics penicillin with rifampin and clindamycin in one drug has been recommended to kill GAS. There is not much proof that the antibiotic azithromycin works.
Surgery is not recommended.
Experts comment that GAS infection is a common reason for antibiotic use and overuse in children and people who have GAS without symptoms are the most common carriers in the community.
Many things are not clear, and good studies are needed to make decisions.
