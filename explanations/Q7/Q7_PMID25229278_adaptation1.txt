How is strep throat treated?

Sore throat/tonsillitis, or when the back of the throat or tonsils is inflamed, is common.
Many viruses and bacteria can cause short-term sore throat. However, group A strep, caused by Group A strep bacteria, is the only cause that must be identified based on signs and symptoms and treated.
Group A strep bacteria are important to identify because they can cause post-strep throat complications throughout the body, acute rheumatic fever (a disease that inflames the body's tissues), and post-strep throat kidney disease.
Strep throat symptoms usually happen quickly and include severe sore throat, fever, chills, general discomfort, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck, and white or yellow spots on the throat or tonsils.
Cough, cold symptoms, pink eye, and diarrhea are not common and might be caused by a virus.
Learning the person's history and doing a physical exam are used to diagnose strep throat.
A throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick is the best way to diagnose strep throat.
However, it has not been used as much as it should because it is not widely available and takes 1 to 2 days to get results.
Rapid strep tests have been used to find fragments of bacteria that cause strep throat from swabs within minutes.
Scoring systems have been made to predict the risk of strep throat.
The modified Centor score is the most common scoring survey.
Short-term strep throat often goes away on its own without treatment.
Penicillins, a type of antibiotics, are prescribed most commonly.
For people allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, another type of antibiotics, can be prescribed, although people can be allergic to cephalosporins.
Another drug option is macrolides, another type of antibiotics.
Making an anti-strep throat vaccine could be one way to prevent strep throat and post-strep throat complications throughout the body in the future.
