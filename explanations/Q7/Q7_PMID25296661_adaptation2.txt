How is strep throat treated?

Identifying bacterial group A strep (Strep A) throat infection by examination is difficult. Misidentifying may lead to innappropriate antibacterial antibiotic use.
Most with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibacterial antibiotics, so therapies that relieve symptoms should be promoted.
We show two trials on the success and safety of anti-inflammatory fluriboprofen lozenges in those with and without strep throat.
The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and with inflammation of the pharynx (specific throat area).
The practitioner measured risk of Strep A bacterial infection by historical and medical findings.
Patients were randomised to anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen or inactive treatment. They also reported three throat symptoms at start and regular intervals over 24 hours.
402 patients received treatment (203 with antinflammatory flurbiprofen and 199 with inactive treatment).
Testing isolated throat cells identified bacterial Strep A in 10% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in another 14%.
The practitioners correctly identified Strep A in 11/40 cases.
A single anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen lozenge gave more relief than the inactive treatment for all three throat symptoms and for 3-4 hours.
Multiple doses of flurbiprofen over 24 hours led to mild, negligible symptom relief.
There were no serious side effects.
It is difficult identifying bacterial Strep A by clinical features.
With growing antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered.
As seen here, anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen lozenges are effective treatment, giving immediate and long-lasting symptom relief.
