How is strep throat treated?

A European scientific organization made a Sore Throat Guideline Group to write a new guideline to diagnose and treat people with short-term sore throat.
A common sore throat scoring survey or a rapid strep test involving a quick throat swab to find bacterial fragments can be useful in deciding which antibiotic to use.
The sore throat scoring survey can help identify people who are more likely to have group A strep, caused by group A strep bacteria.
Doctors might use a rapid strep test in people who are highly likely to have strep throat based on the sore throat scoring survey.
If the rapid strep test shows no strep infection, a throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick is not needed.
Advil or Tylenol can help short-term sore throat symptoms.
Zinc gluconate should not be used in sore throat.
It is unclear whether herbal treatments and acupuncture can help sore throat.
People with less serious sore throat (low throat scoring survey score, for example) should not use antibiotics to help sore throat.
Moderate benefits of antibiotics, seen in people with higher throat survey scores, have to be compared to side effects, effects on small organisms that live in or on the human body, the ability of bacteria to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them, people more likely to seek medical care for future illness and costs.
Preventing pus formation is not a reason for using antibiotics to help sore throat.
If using antibiotics, taking penicillin V two to three times a day for 10 days is suggested.
Currently, taking antibiotics for fewer than 10 days is not recommended.
