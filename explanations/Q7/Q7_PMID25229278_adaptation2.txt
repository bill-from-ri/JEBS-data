How is strep throat treated?

Immediate pharyngitis/tonsillitis, characterized by inflammation of the pharynx (an airway in the throat) and tonsils, is a common disease.
Many viruses and bacteria can cause immediate pharyngitis (throat inflammation). However, only Streptoccocus pyogenes (a specific bacteria) needs identification and specific treatment.
S. pyogenes, a specific bacteria, is important since it can trigger post-infection issues, immediate rheumatic fever, and kidney disease.
Symptoms start abruptly in strep bacterial infection and include intense sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache, enlarged neck lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar fluid leakage.
Cough, nose and eye inflammation, and diarrhea are uncommon. Their presence suggests a viral cause.
Identifying pharynx, or throat, inflammation is supported by patient history and physical examination.
Testing throat cells are the gold standard for identifying strep throat.
However, testing isolated throat cells is underused due to its low availability and 1- to 2-day delay for results.
Rapid antigen, or foreign protein, detection tests may detect bacterial S. pyogenes from throat swabs in minutes.
Medical scoring systems have been created to predict risk of S. pyogenes bacterial infection.
The most common scoring system is the modified Centor score.
Immediate strep throat is often a self-resolving disease.
Penicillins, or antibacterial drugs, are the first-choice treatment.
For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins (another antibacterial) can be an alternative. Although, immediate immune responses to cephalosporins can occur.
Another antibiotic option is macrolides.
Future options to prevent strep throat and associated issues include developing an anti-Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial vaccine.
