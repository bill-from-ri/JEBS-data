At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Twenty-five patients with a primary DSM-III-R diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were treated openly with the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine for up to 12 months.
For most patients, treatment was initiated at 5 mg/day to minimize adverse effects previously reported with initiation at higher doses.
Nineteen (76%) experienced moderate to marked improvement in panic attacks.
Four (16%) were unable to tolerate fluoxetine due to adverse effects.
Initiating treatment of panic disorder with low doses of fluoxetine may increase its acceptability and permit more patients to benefit from fluoxetine.
