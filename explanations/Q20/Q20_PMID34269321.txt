At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Objective: A large number of people experience misophonia.
In 2013, the Amsterdam Study Group recommended diagnostic criteria for misophonia.
However, misophonia is not yet included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
This report is the first report on drug use that directly affects misophonia and demonstrates a 14-year-old adolescent girl with misophonia successfully treated with fluoxetine.
Methods: The patient's misophonia symptoms had been continuing for approximately 2 years, and her quality of life was significantly reduced.
Psychotherapy conditions could not be applied, and fluoxetine 10 mg/d was started and increased to 20 mg/d after a week.
At the second-month follow-up, because of partial improvement, fluoxetine dose was increased to 30 mg/d.
Results: At the fourth-month follow-up, there was a 40% decrease in Amsterdam Misophonia Scale score with a 70% decrease in the children's global assessment scale scores.
By the 16th week, the overall functionality level was good at the end.
Conclusions: Fluoxetine may be used as an effective drug in the treatment of misophonia.
