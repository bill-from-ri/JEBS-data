At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Twenty-five patients with panic disorder were treated with the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (a common antidepressant) for up to 12 months.
For most, treatment started with 5 mg/day to reduce side effects.
Nineteen (76%) showed improvement in panic attacks.
Four (16%) could not stand fluoxetine due to its side effects.
Using low starting doses of fluoxetine for panic disorders may improve its acceptability and use.
