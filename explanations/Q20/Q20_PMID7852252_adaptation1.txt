At what strength is prozac usually begun for a patient changing from another antidepressant?

Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration. Although several studies have examined how well antidepressants work long-term, there is little attention on how to manage relapses (the worsening of a medical condition that had previously improved) or recurrences (when symptoms return months or years after a person has recovered from the last episode) during continued use of antidepressant drugs.
This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) at 20 mg/day will benefit from an increase dose of fluoxetine.
In this study, 18 patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a larger study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month.
Twelve (67%) were full responders (patients who reached the expected improvement), 3 (17%) partial responders (patients who reached only part of the expected improvement), and 3 (17%) dropped out of the study because of side effects (e.g. insomnia and agitation).
Of those 15 patients who had either full or partial response, 3 complete responders had a recurrence on 40 mg/day after an average of 5.8 months and 1 partial responder had a recurrence 11 months later.
Overall, 11 (61%) of 18 patients still reacted to the drug during their follow-up while taking the higher dose of fluoxetine.
In conclusion, an increase in dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg/day appears to be an effective way to help treat relapse among people with depression who had initially responded to fluoxetine at 20 mg/day.
