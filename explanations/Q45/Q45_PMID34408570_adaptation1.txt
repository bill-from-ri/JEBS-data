Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Treatment of bedsores is a serious medical problem.
Often, a bedsore is hard to cure, especially when it is deep and covers a large area, and usually has a poor prognosis (plan for recovery).
Treating bedsores requires specialized dressings, which play an important role in the healing process.
We aim to rate how well active specialized dressings, which promote healing by keeping the wound moist, work to treat bedsores.
We looked at 40 patients, 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, with bedsores differing in size and depth, located near the bottom of the spine, lasting from 1.5 to 3.0 months.
We randomly assigned patients to two groups of 20 people each and treated them with two different specialist dressings for 4 weeks.
We used ATRAUMAN ag, which contains silver ions, in the first group and paraffin (waxy) gauze of BACTIGRAS type in the second group.
We measured the progress of bedsore healing by measuring the wound's boundaries, which calculates the surface area.
Results showed average bedsore surface area significantly decreased in the first group by 60.2% and in the second group by 32.95%, suggesting dressings with silver ions worked better.
We conclude that specialist dressings significantly decrease bedsore surface area, and dressings with silver ions work better than those without.
