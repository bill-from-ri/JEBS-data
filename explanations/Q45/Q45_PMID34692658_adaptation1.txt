Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Bedsores are a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because it causes long-lasting inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and harms the extracellular matrix (ECM; secreted by cells and surrounds cells in tissues) from not enough oxygen and blood flow.
The study we did before found that non-fouling zwitterionic (inner salts to which proteins and bacteria cannot stick) sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve bedsore healing and quickly rebuild ECM.
However, scientists are unsure how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM.
In this study, we look at how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM using a rat bedsore model.
SMBA hydrogel helps remodel ECM better than PEG hydrogel, another bedsore treatment.

The relationship between autophagy (cleaning out of damaged cells) with ECM remodeling may influence the design of wound dressings with substances that interact with biological systems for long-term wound repair.
