Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

The effect of nifedipine (a common vasodilator medication that widens blood vessels) on pressure ulcers (PU), or bedsores, has not been measured in humans.
In this study, the effect of skin-level application of nifedipine 3% ointment on PU healing in very ill patients was investigated.
This was a randomized study with a sham treatment group.
In this study, 200 patients with mild and moderate PU were randomzed to receive topical nifedipine 3% ointment or dummy treatment twice daily for 14 days.
Changes in the size and severity of ulcers were the main measures of the study.
The severity of ulcers at baseline, on day 7, and on day 14 of the study was measured.
Also, the area of the wounds was estimated by multiplying width by length.
In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study.
The groups were matched for starting severity and size of PUs.
Average decrease in the severity of PU in the nifedipine group was higher than the dummy treatment group on day 7 and day 14.
Also, the average decrease in the area of PU was higher in the nifedipine group compared with the sham treatment group on day 7 and 14 of the study.
Skin-level application of nifedipine 3% ointment for 14 days improved the healing process of mild or moderate PUs in very ill patients.
