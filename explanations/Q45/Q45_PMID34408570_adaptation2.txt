Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Treating decubitus ulcers (bedsores) is a serious medical problem.
In many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer or bedsore, especially when it is deep and extensive. Recovery is usually poor.
Treating bedsores requires new specialized dressings (e.g., ointments, gauze), which are important for healing.
We aim to evaluate the success of active specialized medical dressings for treating bedsores.
Research included 40 patients - 18 (45% women) and 22 (55%) men, suffering from bedsores of various size and depth, in the lower back, lasting from 1.5 to 30 months.
Patients were randomly split to two groups (20 people each) and treated for 4 weeks with either ATRAUMAN Ag, a dressing with silver, or gauze with paraffin (a waxy substance commonly used for coating and sealing candles and rubbers) from BACTIGRAS.
Measuring pressure ulcer healing was done by measuring the wound surface area.
The results showed a decrease in average bedsore area in both treatment groups: in the first group by 60.2% and in the second group by 32.95%, which speaks in favour of dressings with silver as better treatments.
Using specialized dressings leads to a decrease in bedsore area, depending on the dressing type and substances contained within it. Silver supports the healing properties of the dressing used.
