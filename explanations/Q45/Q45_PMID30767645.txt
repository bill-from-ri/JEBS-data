Do i keep a pressure sore covered and moist and what kind of ointment to use?

Products that provide a protective skin barrier play a vital role in defending the skin against the corrosive effect of bodily fluids, including wound exudate, urine, liquid faeces, stoma output and sweat.
There are many products to choose from, which can be broadly categorised by ingredients.
This article describes the differences in mechanisms of action between barrier products comprising petrolatum and/or zinc oxide, silicone film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates, and compares the evidence on them.
The literature indicates that all types of barrier product are clinically effective, with little comparative evidence indicating that any one ingredient is more efficacious than another, although film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates have been found to be easier to apply and more cost-effective.
However, laboratory evidence, albeit limited, indicates that a concentrated cyanoacrylate produced a more substantial and adherent layer on a porcine explant when compared with a diluted cyanoacrylate and was more effective at protecting skin from abrasion and repeated exposure to moisture than a film-forming polymer.
Finally, a silicone-based cream containing micronutrients was found to significantly reduce the incidence of pressure ulceration when used as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy.
