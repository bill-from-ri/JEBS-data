Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome (BHD) is a rare, inherited disorder that leads to hair follicle tumors, kidney tumors, and lungs cysts or swellings.
BHD is caused by DNA mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene, which helps create a tumor stopping protein or molecule.
While managing low-risk kidney tumors is primary for long-term care, lung issues like cyst formation and random lung collapsions are common in BHD.
Due to unawareness, identifying BHD is usually delayed. Patients are frequently mislabeled with long-lasting, interfering lung disease, emphysema (a lung disease involving damaged air sacs), or fluid-filled blisters.
A family history of collapsing lungs is present in 35% of patients with BHD.
Certain attributes of cysts, like size, location, and shape, can help identify BHD by medical imaging alone.
Reoccuring collapsing lungs are common. Early removal of the space between the lungs and chest wall is recommended.
We need to better understand how FLCN affects lung cyst formation and how lung problems from BHD develop.
