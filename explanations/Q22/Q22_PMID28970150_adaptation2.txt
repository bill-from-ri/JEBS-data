Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Heritable DNA mutations in the new tumor stopping gene FLCN lead to the genetic Birt-Hogg-Dub√© (BHD) syndrome. The syndrome causes hair follicle tumors, lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, and an increased risk for kidney tumors.
While the full protein, folliculin (FLCN), is not similar to other proteins, one end of FLCN is structurally similar to the ends of other proteins that help activate high-energy proteins.

This review summarizes FLCN studies regarding its role in cellular, signaling, and cell structure pathways.
Current research is on explaining the FLCN-associated pathway driving the creation of hair follicle tumors, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in BHD patients with heritable FLCN mutations.
