Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome (BHD) is a rare, genetic disorder caused by a DNA mutation. The disorder causes hair follicle tumors, kidney cancer, lung cysts, and collapsed lungs.
The exact creation of tumor and lung cyst or swellings in BHD is unclear.
Physical symptoms, like skin, lung, and kidney abnormalities, vary in patients with BHD.
Over 80% of adult patients with BHD have lung cysts or swellings seen via medical imaging of the chest.
