Where do bhd patients get cysts?

Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder associated with the development of hair follicle tumors, kidney tumors and pulmonary cysts, which are sacs filled with air in the lungs.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé is caused by a change in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. This gene makes a protein that is involved is slowing or stopping the development of tumors.
Although care for kidney tumors that have a low risk of becoming cancerous is the main focus of long term care, common lung problems in Birt-Hogg-Dubé include cysts and sudden collapsed lung (when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall).
Because of the lack of awareness, there is often a delay of diagnosis for lung problems with Birt-Hogg-Dubé, and patients are often given an incorrect diagnosis of another lung disease.
A family history of a collapsed lung is present in 35% of patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé.
Certain characteristics of cysts, such as size, location, and shape, can suggest the diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé by using a chest x-ray.
A collapsed lung that continues to occur are common and doing a procedure called pleurodesis early on that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall is recommended.
A better understanding of the FLCN gene's role in the formation of lung cysts and long term studies to understand the natural history of lung problems of Birt-Hogg-Dubé are needed.
