Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are usually given by mouth, but it is hard to measure if people take the drugs as instructed.
Slow-releasing shots, created in the 1960s, became popular as long-term treatment to keep conditions stable.
Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are slow-release shots used to treat psychotic disorders.
We aimed to measure the medical, social, and economic effects of slow-releasing perphenazine decanoate and enanthate shots compared to no treatment, drugs used to treat psychotic disorders by mouth, and other slow-releasing shots used to treat psychotic disorders for people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness).
We state that slow-releasing perphenazine shots are used in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands.
At least 250,000 people have schizophrenia in these countries and could be given slow-releasing perphenazine shots.
The four trials with useful results had 313 total people.
None of the studies compared the effects of antipsychotics taken by mouth to a slow-releasing shot.
People with schizophrenia should use their own judgement until more studies are done and doctors know the effects of slow-release perphenazine shots.
