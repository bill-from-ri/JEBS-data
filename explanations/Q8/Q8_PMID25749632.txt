Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Background: Perphenazine is an old phenothiazine antipsychotic with a potency similar to haloperidol.
It has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan.
Objectives: To examine the clinical effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.
Authors' conclusions: Although perphenazine has been used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparators used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions.
All data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence.
At best we can say that perphenazine showed similar effects and adverse events as several of the other antipsychotic drugs.
Since perphenazine is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used compound, further trials are justified to clarify the properties of this classical antipsychotic drug.
