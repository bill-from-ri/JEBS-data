Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Despite newer anti-nausea drugs, perphenazine (an anti-psychotic) is still used in multimodal treatment of nausea and vomiting post-operation in high-risk patients that need two or more drugs.
This work measures the success and safety of perphenazine in preventing post-operation nausea and vomiting.
Eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 included 2081 total participats for analysis.
In children, 0.07 mg kg of perphenzaine prevented vomiting while 5 mg prevented post-operation nausea and vomiting in adults.
Compared to newer anti-nausea and -vomiting drugs, no differences were observed.
Reporting of harmful events was poor.
Three trials reported temporary sedation or a calming effect.
Perphenazine may be effective in preventing post-operation nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious harmful effects.
