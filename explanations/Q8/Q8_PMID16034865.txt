Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Background: Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify.
The development of depot injections in the 1960s gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment.
Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are depot antipsychotics that belong to the phenothiazine family and have a piperazine ethanol side chain.
Objectives: To assess the effects of depot perphenazine decanoate and enanthate versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.
Authors' conclusions: Depot perphenazine is in clinical use in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands.
At a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine.
The total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313.
None of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs.
Until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised.
