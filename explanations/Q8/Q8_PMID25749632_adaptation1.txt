Who is prescribed perphenazine?

Perphenazine is an old drug used to treat psychotic disorders with strength similar to haloperidol, another drug to treat psychotic disorders.
Perphenazine has been used for many years and is popular in the northern European countries and Japan.
We aimed to look at the effects and safety of perphenazine in people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness) and schizophrenia-like disorders.
We conclude that although perphenazine has been used for more than 50 years, incomplete results and the variety of drugs used to compare perphenazine to make it impossible to make clear judgements.
The results used in this review were not reliable.
The most we can say is that perphenazine had similar results and side effects as many other drugs used to treat psychotic disorders.
Because perphenazine is a cheap and often used drug, more studies are needed to fully understand the drug's properties.
