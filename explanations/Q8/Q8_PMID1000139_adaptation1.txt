Who is prescribed perphenazine?

The chemical structure (arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule) of drugs used to treat psychotic disorders does not reliably predict how well the treatment works.
We looked into whether the biological and chemical changes made to the body by a drug to treat psychotic disorders might better predict how well the treatment works.
We did a study of how well antipsychotics clozapine and perphenazine treat short-term impaired relationships with reality with varying symptoms and causes.
Data suggest that clozapine and perphenazine have opposite effects on two types of neurons or brain cells.
We thought that perphenazine would be a stronger drug to treat impaired relationships with reality and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa.
This assumption proved reasonable.
Partly based on earlier research, we concluded that the biological and chemical changes to the body made by a drug used to treat psychotic disorders better predicts how well the treatment works than the arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule.
