Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Doctors have realized recently that zinc is very important to health.
The cells in the intestines keep the body's zinc level balanced.
Many factors determine how much and how well zinc is absorbed by the body. The most important factor is the amount of zinc a person gets.
Two other factors are a person's age and the length of time zinc is taken.
The amount of zinc absorbed by the body is not different whether the zinc comes from supplements like pills or from food.
Some compounds found in certain foods can make it harder for the body to absorb zinc. 
The body absorbs zinc differently depending on the amount of zinc or the amount of phytate in the amount already.
The results were added to previous data and now we know that adults can absorb at most 6mg of zinc a day. A person needs to take double the normal amount of zinc if getting 1000mg of phytate through food and medication.
The body gets rid of zinc according to how much zinc is already in the body and how much has been absorbed recently.
How much zinc is lost and how much is absorbed is important to know so that people get the right amount of zinc.
The way that phylate affects how much zinc is removed from the body needs to be looked at more. But that effect is probably not as important as the way phylate affects how much zinc gets absorbed in the body.
