Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Yeast with added zinc and the supplement zinc gluconate are two of the best options to get more zinc in your body.
Hardly any research exists comparing the two supplements.
This study wanted to see which supplement was better in healthy men.

Researchers collected urine, blood, and poop samples over two days after the men took one dose of the supplement.
The researchers calculated the amount of zinc in the body in multiple ways.
The researchers found no differences in the amount of zinc lost from urinating.
Men had higher amounts of zinc in the blood during the first 6 hours after taking it, but lost more zinc from poop. 
Men also had higher zinc in the blood after taking the yeast with zinc. However, men lost a lot less zinc through poop.
The results show that the zinc gluconate supplement may result in a loss of zinc in the body.
In conclusion, the yeast with zinc supplement gave the body more zinc than the zinc gluconate supplement.
