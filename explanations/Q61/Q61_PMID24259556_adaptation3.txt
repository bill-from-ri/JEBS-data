Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Various types of zinc are commonly used as supplements in tablet or syrup forms. These supplements prevent the body from lacking zinc and help treat children's diarrhea along with liquids.
Zinc citrate is a form of zinc that dissolves slightly in water and allows more zinc into the body. It is better in syrup form but there is no data on how well its zinc is absorbed in the human body.
This study compared how well zinc from zinc citrate is absorbed in the body by giving 15 people 10 mg of the zinc citrate without requiring them to take it along with food. The results were compared to how well zinc gulconate and zinc oxide were absorbed.
Zinc citrate was as good as zinc gluconate at being absorbed by the body.
Zinc oxide was the worst of the three at being absorbed by the body.
Three people did not absorb or barely absorbed any zinc from the zinc oxide.
The results show that zinc citrate is as good as zinc gulconate at being absorbed by the human body. It is another good option to prevent lack of zinc in the body and for treating diarrhea.
The zinc oxide form is not absorbed as well by the human body when given without food. Some people may not absorb any zinc at all or may barely absorb any.
