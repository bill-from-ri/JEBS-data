Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

We studied how much zinc gets into the body of 15 healthy volunteers after they took different supplements. 
The volunteers were split into four groups in no particular order. 
Volunteers in each group took one of these supplements for four weeks: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc gluconate or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs). The pills contained the same amount of zinc. The groups switched to a different drug every week in no particular order. 
Zinc was measured in hair, urine, and blood before and after each switch.	
At the end of four weeks levels of zinc in hair, urine and red blood cells were much higher in those who took zinc picolinate.
There was no change in the levels of zinc in the body after taking zinc gluconate, zinc citrate or placebo.
There was a small rise in the levels of zinc in the clear liquid part of the blood after taking  zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo.
Levels of zinc in the body can be improved by supplements that combine zinc with picolinic acid, a natural product found in many organisms.
