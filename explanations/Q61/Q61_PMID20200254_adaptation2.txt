Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Zinc is now believed to be an extremely important micronutrient. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are needed for healthy development, disease prevention, and wellbeing. 
The body maintains the balance of zinc through special chemicals that take the zinc into cells according to needs. 
How much and how well zinc is taken into the body depends on its amount in the food and other factors. 
Other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested.
There is no difference between the ways zinc from supplements and the meals are taken into the body.
The foods, such as grains, which contain phytates, chemicals that prevent minerals from getting into the body, may prevent zinc from getting into the body. 
Models show that the majority of differences in how much zinc will get into the body is due to the presence of zinc and phytate in the food. 
Our model shows that an adult body takes in about 6 milligrams a day.  If the daily meals contain a gram of phytate, twice the recommended daily amount of zinc is needed. 
Zinc is removed with stools depending on how much zinc the body took in and how much was present. 
The relation between zinc that is taken in and removed determines how much zinc should be taken. 
Phytate might play a role on how much zinc that is already in the body is removed with stools. This role is probably not as important as in preventing zinc in the food from getting into the body.
