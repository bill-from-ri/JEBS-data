Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

Extra zinc is good for conditions like eye diseases that cause loss of sight.
Research suggests that how much zinc is absorbed by the body is affected by the form of the zinc taken.
This study compares using two different forms of zinc, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide.
This study included men ages 21 to 31. They received one type of zinc pills for two weeks, then the other form of zinc pills for two weeks with a two week break between the sets.

The maximum amount of zinc in the blood was higher after taking zinc gluconate than when taking zinc oxide.
The amount of zinc in the blood over a day was higher when taking zinc gluconate than when taking zinc oxide. However the time it took to be at max zinc was the same for both forms of zinc.
In conclusion, people absorb zinc better when it is in the zinc gluconate form.
