Is zinc gluconate or zinc citrate easiest to metabolize by the body?

New treatments are needed for Herpes.
The pomegranate fruit has been used to fight infections since ancient times.
This study looked at how zinc and extract from pomegranate rinds (PRE) affect herpes.
PRE and zinc were used against herpes and drug resistant herpes in monkey cells.

Four types of zinc pills with PRE were strong against the herpes virus.

Another compound found in certain plants including pomegranates called punicalagin is 8 times more active against viruses than the same amount of PRE.
However, other data showed that punicalagin was less active against viruses than PRE and was comparable to the drug aciclovir. PRE was still effective against drug resistant herpes unlike aciclovir.
Zinc sulfate did not affect the ability of PRE to fight the herpes virus.
There were no bad effects on the cells from any of the test treatments.
The ability of PRE to fight viruses with zinc could be a new treatment for herpes infections such as cold sores.
