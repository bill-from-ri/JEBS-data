How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

The coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the SARS-CoV-2 (the novel breathing-related coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19) is included.
Its main structural proteins are the membrane (M) (a thin layer of lipids that protects the cell and acts as a barrier), the envelope (E) (a small membrane protein and is involved in parts of a virus life cycle), the nucleocapsid (N) (an important protein for viral replication and genome packaging) and spike (S) (a protein involved in introducing coronavirus into host cells).
The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular (white blood cells that defend the body against infection) and the humoral sides (molecules that create antibodies against a specific antigen and involve substances found in the humors, or body fluids).
There are some data of the percentage of people in a population who have antibodies to an infectious virus. These data are sometimes used to find out how well people are protected from a virus.
In Spain, it is suggested that to reach herd immunity (a form of indirect protection from an infectious disease that can occur when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection), at least four-fifths of a population (about 80%) should have immunity.
Due to the high death rate of COVID-19, being protected by getting the virus is not always reliable, and other measures to reach mass immunization are required.
There are different vaccine types currently being evaluated.
It is expected that these new vaccines will soon be available to the public.
This text reviews different issues related to vaccines and immunity.
