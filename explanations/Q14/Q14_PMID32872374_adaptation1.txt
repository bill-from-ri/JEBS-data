How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

Novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which leads to a breathing-related viral disease, is causing deaths around the world and lockdowns.
A weak immune system is a known risk factor for all viral flu infections.
Functional foods are foods that have a potentially positive effect on health beyond providing basic nutrition. Functional foods help the immune system work better to prevent and control viral infections. Physical activity strengthens these benefits.
Exercise boosts the immune system, and how often people exercise relates to how much the immune system is strengthened.
Functional foods that prevent non-communicable (non-infectious and chronic) disease can be used to protect against respiratory viral infections and COVID-19.
Functional foods within popular diets include a number of immune-boosting additives, vitamins, and minerals.
Foods with antiviral (infection fighting) effects include fruits, vegetables, fermented foods and probiotics, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, amino acids, peptides (protein segments), and cyclotides (peptides from plants).
Regular moderate exercise (movement that gets the heart beating faster) may help reduce the risk of getting the virus and help people sleep better, in addition to a healthy diet and functional foods.
Lifestyle and healthy nutrition with functional foods may offer additional antiviral approaches for public health.
