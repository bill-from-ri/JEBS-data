How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral breathing-related disease, was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
Challenges arise on how to best support the immune system (a complex network of tissues, organs, cells, and proteins that defends the body against infection) in the general population.
The best immune response depends on enough food and nutrition in order to keep infections away.
For example, eating enough protein is important for producing antibodies (a protective protein used by the immune system in response to an infection).
A lack of nutrients (vitamins and minerals) in the body, such as vitamin A or zinc, is associated with an increased risk of infection.
Frequently, low nutrient status in the body is associated with inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness) and oxidative stress (a condition that happens when nutrients and minerals that protect cells are low), which can impact the immune system.
Foods that can help relieve inflammation and have antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) have vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals (compounds found in fruits and vegetables).
Several of these foods can interact with proteins in the body that are related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
Vitamin D in particular may help prevent the viral infection from entering cells.
Fiber in foods has also been shown to fight inflammation.
This review highlights the importance of the best levels of key nutrients to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in a stronger immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.
