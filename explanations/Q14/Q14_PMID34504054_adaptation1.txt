How to increase body immunity against covid 19?

As COVID-19, a viral breathing-related disease, continues to spread rapidly worldwide and variants continue to emerge, the development and distribution of safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed.
Researchers developed an mRNA vaccine (a vaccine that introduces or copies a piece of messenger RNA - genetic material - that corresponds to a virus) that is based on trimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) (part of the virus located on the spike protein which is involved in introducing a virus into host cells) and is fused to TF-RBD, tiny molecules that protect the copies called nanoparticles.
The TF-RBD nanoparticles delivered humoral immunity (immunity in which molecules create antibodies against a specific antigen and involve substances found in the humors, or body fluids) as well as a cellular response (using white blood cells that are part of the body's natural immune system).
Immunization with two shots of a low dose vaccine of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in mice.
In addition, the mRNA template of TF-RBD vaccine was easily and quickly changed into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations.
The TF-RBD vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies (antibodies that defends a cell from an infectious particle by neutralizing any effect it has) against Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants.
This mRNA vaccine based on self-assembled nanoparticles provides support for future designs of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.
