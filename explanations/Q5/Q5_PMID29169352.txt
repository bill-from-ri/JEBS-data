How to treat a bakers cyst?

Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage and cyst cavity debridement operation of popliteal cyst in knee osteoarthritis patients.
Methods: From August 2007 to March 2013, 58 knee osteoarthritis patients with popliteal cyst were treated with arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage through posteromedial portal and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal.
In all patients, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to detect combined intra-articular pathology and the communication between popliteal cyst and knee cavity.
Clinical efficacy was evaluated through VAS score and Lysholm score.
Results: All patients had neither recurrence of popliteal cyst nor complaints of pain, swelling, or functional impairment at average 24 months follow-up after surgery.
Postoperatively, VAS score was decreased significantly and Lysholm score was raised significantly comparing preoperatively.
Conclusion: Arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage operation through posteromedial portal and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal is an effective minimally invasive surgery method for the treatment of popliteal cyst without recurrence in knee osteoarthritis patients.
