How to treat a bakers cyst?

This work compared internal joint drainage of fluid-filled swellings or cysts alone or with cyst wall removal surgery.
Forty-two patients with typical fluid-filled cysts or pockets received joint treatment.
Specifically, 20 received joint or arthroscopic internal drainage (AI group alone) and 22 received internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery or resection (AICR group) in two locations.
We identified reappearance of fluid-filled cysts with medical imaging.
We also took knee-specific clinical measurements.
The average follow-up period was 24 months.
The two treatment groups were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, initial clinical scores, and follow-up period.
Relative to the internal joint drainage alone group, the internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery group had increased operation time and more difficulties.
In both groups, cyst scores at the last follow-up differed from the starting score. The knee scores improved compared to starting scores; however, the two groups did not differ at the last follow-up.
According to imaging results, the fluid-filled swelling disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in 6 (30%), and existed in 3 (15%) patients of the internal joint drainage alone group. The cyst was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in 4 (18.2%) patients of the internal joint dranage with cyst wall removal surgery group, implying a difference between the two groups.
Additional cyst wall removal surgery can lower reappearance rate of cysts (fluid-filled pockets) but increase operation time and surgery complications compared with internal joint drainage of cysts alone.
