How to treat a bakers cyst?

Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with Baker's cyst, which is an abnormal enlargement of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee
Other knee joint injuries or disorders can also cause Baker's cyst
Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis because it targets inflammation
Inflammation increases the amount of fluid, or synovia, in the knee. So we asked if radiotherapy may reduce both the production of synovia and volume of Baker's cyst.
To answer this question, we performed a prospective trial, where we examined 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis.
We assigned scores for the degree of osteoarthitis and calculated the cyst volume for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up.
We measured cyst volume by ultrasound,
and found that low-dose radiotherapy improved knee osteoarthritis scores significantly.
The average volume of Baker's cysts also decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively during follow-up.
A decrease in cyst volume of more than 25% compared to the starting volume could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term, and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up.
We conclude that radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a Baker's cyst.
Most patients respond to this treatment.
