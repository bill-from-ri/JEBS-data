How to treat a bakers cyst?

To reduce the damage to posteromedial knee capsule, we developed a direct extra-articular arthroscopic approach for excision of symptomatic popliteal cysts.
This study aimed to demonstrate the surgical technique and present the 2-year follow-up results.
Cystectomy is performed by extra-articular surgical approach through a high posteromedial portal.
Twenty-one consecutive patients diagnosed of symptomatic popliteal cysts with failed initial conservative treatments were included.
At a median follow-up of 29.4 months, all knees had improved clinical function assessed by Rauschning and Lindgren knee classification (p<0.001).
The cysts were either disappeared (95.2%) or reduced in size (4.8%).
Only one (4.8%) patient had recurrent cyst, which was solved after ultrasound-guided aspiration.
This direct extra-articular arthroscopic technique could be a feasible alternative for treatment of symptomatic popliteal cysts.
