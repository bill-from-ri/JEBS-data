How to treat a bakers cyst?

Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee.  Arthroscopy (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) is a treatment method for popliteal cysts. To reduce the damage to posteromedial (middle, side)  knee capsule associated with this treatment, we have developed a direct arthroscopic approach from outside the knee joint (extra-articular) for removal of symptomatic popliteal cysts.
This study aims to demonstrate the surgical technique and present the 2-year follow-up results.
Removal of the cyst (cystectomy) is performed by an extra-articular surgical approach, where a small hole is made in the side of the knee above the knee joint (a high posteromedial portal).
We included twenty-one patients diagnosed with symptomatic popliteal cysts who had unsuccesful previous conservative treatments in our study.
At a median follow-up time of 29.4 months, all knees had improved clinical function assessed by Rauschning and Lindgren knee classification criteria scores.
The cysts had either disappeared (95.2%) or reduced in size (4.8%).
Only one (4.8%) patient had a recurrent cyst, which was removed by ultrasound-guided aspiration.
This direct extra-articular arthroscopic technique could be a feasible alternative treatment for symptomatic popliteal cysts.
