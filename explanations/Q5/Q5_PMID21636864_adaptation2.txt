How to treat a bakers cyst?

The objective is to review the results and issues of joint treatment of fluid-filled swellings or cysts in our treatment center. 
From July 2007 to July 2009, 11 patients with typical fluid-filled swellings behind the knee were treated with minor joint surgery.
All patients had pre-operation imaging to confirm the problem, identify the source, and the associated joint symptoms.

Intra-joint symptoms like cartilage deterioration and tears were associated with fluid-filled swellings behind the knee.
All patients improved after treatment. Reappearance rate was low.
No major issues were encountered.
We failed to correct any swelling sources in one patient.
Minor joint surgery of fluid-filled pockets or cysts behind the knee with correction of the source and symptom treatment is effective and safe.
