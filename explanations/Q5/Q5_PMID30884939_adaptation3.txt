How to treat a bakers cyst?

Popliteal cyst, also known as Baker's cyst, occurs in the knee region.
Popliteal cysts are caused by increased pressure on the knee joint which results in the abnormal enlargement of a bursa (protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee to form a cyst.
Orthopedic specialists can diagnose popliteal cysts using X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis of popliteal cysts
Treatment options for popliteal cysts include conservative treatment, traditional surgery, and arthroscopic surgery.
In recent years, treatment of popliteal cysts has shifted from traditional surgical removal of the cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, with good results.
However, controversy remains over which treatment method is best.
High quality studies that directly compare different surgical methods should help select the best treatment for popliteal cyst.
This article reviews previous studies and literature, and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, signs and symptoms, lab and imaging results,  diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts
We compare and summarize different methods to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment of popliteal cyst.
