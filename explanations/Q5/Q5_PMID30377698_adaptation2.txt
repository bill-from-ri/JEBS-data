How to treat a bakers cyst?

Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease, often occuring with Baker's cyst (a fluid-filled pocket behind the knee).
Besides osteoarthritis, other knee joint diseases can lead to an uncomfortable fuild-filled swelling behind the knee.
Radiation therapy treats osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect.
As excess fluid in joints is linked with joint inflammation, radiation therapy may help fluid production in joints and reduce the size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knee.
Our trial includes 29 knees receiving radiation therapy for knee arthritis.
Besides knee pain and function measurements, the size of the cust was measured for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up.

Low-dose radiation therapy improves measurements for knee arthritis.
The size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knees decreased.
75% of patients in the short-term and 79% of patients in the long-term achieved a decrease in size of over 25% relative to baseline scores.
Radiation therapy of knee osteoarthritis decreases the size of a Baker's cyst.
Most patients respond to the treatment.
Whether radiation therapy treats Baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis is unknown.
