How to treat a bakers cyst?

Background:  Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of arthroscopic (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) knee cavity internal drainage and cyst cavity debridement (removing damaged and dead tissue) of popliteal cysts in knee osteoarthritis patients.
Methods: From August 2007 to March 2013, 58 knee osteoarthritis patients with popliteal cyst were treated with arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage through posteromedial portal (small holes, or portals, made in the middle  side of their knees). and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal (a portal above the posteromedial portal) .
All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  to detect combined tissue damage within the knee joint and the communication between the popliteal cyst and knee cavity.
Patients received scores to numerically assess effectiveness of these treatments
Results: All patients had neither recurrence of popliteal cyst nor complaints of pain, swelling, or functional impairment on follow-up examination an average of 24 months after surgery
The pain (VAS) score decreased significantly and knee function (Lysholm) score increased significantly when compared with pre-surgery scores.
We conclude that arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainag eby the posteromedial portal method, and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal are effective treatments for popliteal cyst without recurrence in knee osteoarthritis patients.
