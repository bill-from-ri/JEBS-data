How to treat a bakers cyst?

Popliteal cyst is a common peri-knee cyst, also known as a Baker's cyst.
With the current development of popliteal cysts, the pathogenesis is mainly due to increased pressure in the knee joint caused by various reasons, leading to a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee as a result of enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa.
The current diagnostic methods include X-ray computed, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance.
Among them, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts.
There are various treatments, including conservative treatment, traditional surgical resection and arthroscopic surgery.
In recent years, the focus of the treatment of popliteal cysts has gradually shifted from the simple removal of cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, and achieved a good effect.
However, there are still controversies about the most effective treatment, and the best surgery method is still uncertained.
It is hoped that high quality prospective studies will be able to directly compare different surgery methods, so as to select the best treatment for popliteal cyst.
This article reviews past literature research and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, clinical manifestations and signs, auxiliary examination, diagnosis and differential diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts.
Different diagnosis methods and treatment methods are compared and summarized to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
