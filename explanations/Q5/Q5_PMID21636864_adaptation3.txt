How to treat a bakers cyst?

 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. In this study we evaluated the results for patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analysed their outcomes, including complications.
Patients: From July 2007 to July 2009, we treated 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts by arthtroscopy.
All of these patients had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valve opening of the cysts, and the associated tissue damage within the knee joint (intra-articular pathology).
We used the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria tp evaluate knee joint symptoms.
We found that intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear commonly occurred with popliteal cysts.
All patients' symptoms improved after treatment and the cyst recurrence rate was low.
The patients did not experience any major complications.
However, we failed to identify (and correct) any valve opening in one patient's cyst.
 We conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valve opening, and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe.
