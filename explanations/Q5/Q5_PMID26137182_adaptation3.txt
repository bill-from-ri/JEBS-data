How to treat a bakers cyst?

 Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, commonly occur in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears.
At the tissue level, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue (tissue that contains a protective fluid surrounding the knee joint), but with evident scarring (fibrosis), and there may also be chronic nonspecific inflammation present.
Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may occur within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint.
Baker's cysts can cause posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they routinely appear on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the symptomatic knee.
Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin occur infrequently and may depend on the size of the cyst
A common normal variant of knee synovial tissue shows a capsule-shaped opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa  ( a fluid-filled sac that lies between semimembranosus muscle and superficial muscle in the back part of the lower leg .)
This variant may lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst due to chronic leakage of synovial fluid caused by intra-articular tissue damage .
Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative.
An orthopedic specialist should first use arthroscopy to examine the intra-articular tissue damage .
If surgical removal of the cyst later becomes necessary, the surgeon may use a limited posteromedial approach , where an incision is made in the middle inner side of the knee.
Other treatments, such as arthroscopic removal of damaged tissue (debridement) and closure of the cyst valve , are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended.
