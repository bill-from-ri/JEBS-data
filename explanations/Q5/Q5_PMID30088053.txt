How to treat a bakers cyst?

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to introduce a modified arthroscopic treatment technique for popliteal cyst and hypothesize that this modified technique would provide good clinical efficacy and low recurrence rate.
Methods: From January 2013 to January 2017, 34 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated with our technique.
A figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals were used to achieve adequate enlargement of the posteromedial valvular opening between the cyst and the joint cavity and complete excision of the cyst wall.
MRI was used to detect the recurrence of the popliteal cyst, and the Rauschning and Lindgren score was recorded to evaluate the clinical outcome.
Results: All patients were followed up with a mean period of 14.8 months (range, 12 to 36 months).
Associated intra-articular lesions were found and treated in all cases.
Degenerative cartilage damage was the most common pathology, which affected 23 (67.6%) of the cases.
The Rauschning and Lindgren score improved significantly after surgery, and no evidence of recurrence was found from MRI in any case.
Conclusions: Our modified arthroscopic treatment technique, using a figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals, is effective and safe for treating popliteal cyst.
