How to treat a bakers cyst?

 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. They occur most frequently in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), but are also observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who may experience more serious complications, such as cyst rupture.
In this study, we report four patients with RA in combination with OA, where we examined six knees. We also provide a brief review of literature on previous similar published cases.
This is a retrospective review, where the patients with refractory and/or complicated popliteal cyst have already been treated by arthroscopy,  a minimally-invasive surgical technique using fine instruments for removal of popliteal or Baker's cyst
We suggest that patients with recurring and complicated popliteal cysts associated with RA or RA in combination with OA consider arthroscopic surgeries. These may include removal of damaged or dead tissue (radical debridement), synovectomy (removal of fluid-producing tissue around the knee joint), or excision of the cyst valve, or entire cyst (cystectomy).
