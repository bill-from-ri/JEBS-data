How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

The use of wound dressings that are based on the principles of moist wound healing has recently changed the management of pressure ulcers.
These products may improve healing rates but also offer improved comfort to the patient, reduced dressing time and improved cosmesis.
However, healing is unlikely to be achieved unless the factors that contribute to ulcer formation are addressed.
Principles of management include the elimination or reduction of pressure and other contributing factors, treatment of infection, appropriate wound management, involvement and education of the patient and caregivers, and maintenance of healed tissue.
It is estimated that 95 percent of all pressure ulcers are preventable.
Prevention rather than mere treatment of established ulcers remains a top priority in the effort to reduce the incidence of this common, complex and difficult problem.
Use of assessment tools that quantify the primary risk factors for the development of pressure ulcers is helpful in predicting and preventing compromise of tissue.
