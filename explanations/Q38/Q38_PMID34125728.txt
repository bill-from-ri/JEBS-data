How to heal a pressure wound on the ear?

Mask wearing is now ubiquitous because of the COVID-19 pandemic and has given rise to medical device-related pressure injuries in persons at risk of skin breakdown.
The ear has unique anatomy that is particularly susceptible to injury from pressure.
In this time of mandatory personal protective equipment requirements in healthcare facilities, protection and assessment of skin in the vulnerable postauricular area are needed.
This article presents a case report of a pressure injury on the ear, reviews the anatomy of the ear, and provides strategies for assessment and treatment of pressure injuries in this often overlooked anatomic region.
Treating Mask-Related Pressure Injury: Begin by removing the offending device.
If the patient continues to require a mask, provide a mask or “ear saver” mask strap that secures around the head or back of the neck rather than the ear, although again, this does not remove the need for continued skin assessment to areas subjected to pressure and friction.
Infection should be considered and ruled out.
Local cellulitis is characterized by warmth, redness, pain, and swelling.
Presence of purulent discharge might indicate deeper infection and/or abscess.
If infection is present, treatment should be initiated with topical and/or systemic antibiotics, depending on culture and severity.
Removing hair in the area may be helpful, because it eliminates foreign body intrusion into the wound base, as well as a source of contamination, consistent with the principles of wound bed preparation.
It is important to note that a healed wound may not have the same physical strength as normal tissue and may be prone to recurrence, also known as recidivism.
