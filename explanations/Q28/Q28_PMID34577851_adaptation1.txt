How can covid cause cell injury?

Mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body. These roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). The event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage. One of these products is mitochondrial DNA which can increase inflammation within the body.
This review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). Additionally the paper aimed to show how the mitochondria organelle uses several different ways to allow the replication and maintenance of a virus. This can lead to the worsening and spread of inflammation.
The reviewed scientific evidence suggested that mitochondria are involved in the replication of COVID-19. The virus forms double-walled vesicles, a small chamber outside or within a cell, that evades detection by the host's immune system.
These vesicles can then damage mitochondria within cells, releasing mitochondrial DNA into the body. This can trigger the innate immune system, the defense system you were born with, which increase inflammation within the body.
This review concluded that while the role of the mitochondria in COVID-19 is still being studied, the use of mitochondrial DNA as an indicator of illness is a potential area yet to be researched.
