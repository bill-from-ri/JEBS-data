How can covid cause cell injury?

Some studies reported that genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can absorb a few host miRNAs that regulate immune-related genes and then deprive their function.
In this perspective, we conjecture that the absorption of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to host miRNAs is not a coincidence, which may be an indispensable approach leading to viral survival and development in host.
In our study, we collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
The targets of these miRNAs in the five groups were consistently enriched immune-related pathways and virus-infectious diseases.
Interestingly, the five datasets shared no one miRNA but their targets shared 168 genes.
The signaling pathway enrichment of 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response that the most of interleukin signaling pathways and none of the interferon signaling pathways were significantly different.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the shared targets showed that PPI pairs, including IL6-IL6R, were related to the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.
In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 absorption to host miRNA could benefit two popular mutant strains for more infectivity and pathogenicity.
Conclusively, our results suggest that genomic RNA absorption to host miRNAs may be a vital approach by which SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.
