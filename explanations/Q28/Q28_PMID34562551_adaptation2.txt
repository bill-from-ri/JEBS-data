How can covid cause cell injury?

Some patients of COVID-19 (a respiratory viral illness) suffer issues from anti-viral immune responses. These can lead to a dangerous inflammatory molecule overproduction and blood-borne substances that increase blood clotting risk.
The exact immune response type may determine and predict patient outcomes. It may also be a target for treatment.
Elimination of specific anti-viral immune cells called T cells in the early stages is linked with disease progression.
Damaged T cell function, which is before inflammatory molecule overproduction and expansion in lungs, signals harmful disease effects.
T cell function, inflammatory molecule production and attraction to the lung can be changed by targeting molecules that can alter responses of specific immune cells.
Changing T cell responses by targeting a specific pathway may help control the immune response in COVID-19 patients.
During initial anti-viral response, specific T cell function can be improved by delaying anti-viral elimination by blocking a specific cell pathway.
Also, immune system impairment can be addressed by improving functions to suppress the immune response. This can be done by targeting a specific molecule that influences cellular metabolism.
Targeting this specific cell signaling pathway may prevent blood clotting.
Also, this cellular pathway is needed for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Blocking the pathway could reduce virus amount.
The end goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome.
Targeting different parts of a specific cellular pathway could achieve this immune response control at each stage of the disease.
