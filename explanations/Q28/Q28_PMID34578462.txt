How can covid cause cell injury?

Evidence is emerging that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect various organs of the body, including cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells in the heart.
This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can lead to myocarditis and an outline of potential treatment options.
The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific receptors and proteases for docking and priming in cardiac cells.
Thus, different receptors or protease inhibitors might be effective in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac cells.
(2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for replication.
Drugs acting against ssRNA(+) viral replication for cardiac cells can be effective.
(3) Autophagy and double-membrane vesicles: SARS-CoV-2 manipulates autophagy to inhibit viral clearance and promote SARS-CoV-2 replication by creating double-membrane vesicles as replication sites.
(4) Immune response: Host immune response is manipulated to evade host cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by dysregulating immune cells.
Efficiency of immunosuppressive therapy must be elucidated.
(5) Programmed cell death: SARS-CoV-2 inhibits programmed cell death in early stages and induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in later stages.
(6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disturbed energy metabolism that in turn leads to a decrease in ATP production and ROS production.
(7) Viroporins: SARS-CoV-2 creates viroporins that lead to an imbalance of ion homeostasis.
This causes apoptosis, altered action potential, and arrhythmia.
