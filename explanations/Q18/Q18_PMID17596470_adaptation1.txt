To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

Eating nutrients (foods or substances that allow the body to grow and develop) plays a major role in the health outcomes of all pregnant women.
In a pregnancy that is complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of diabetes first seen during pregnancy in a woman who did not have diabetes before pregnancy), excellent blood sugar control is as important as healthy weight gain and getting enough nutrients.
The disagreement in the care of gestational diabetes mellitus includes the following: how far to change food consumption, how much carbohydrates and fats make up the diet, and how much weight the infant gains during the pregnancy.
Signs that limiting food have gone too far include weight loss or lack of weight gain, undereating to avoid insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) therapy to keep blood sugar normal, positive ketones in urine that indicate the body is using fat for fuel instead of sugar, and planned limits of healthy foods.
If a balance between nutrient needs and sugar control cannot be reached, then providing medication at the same time is needed to help in reducing insulin resistance (a condition that causes increased blood sugar) and increasing insulin to provide normoglycemia (normal amount of sugar in the blood) and improved pregnancy outcomes.
Medical nutrition therapy is a self-management therapy (where the patient is actively engaged in his or her care or treatment).
Education, support, and follow-up are required to help the woman make lifestyle changes that are key to successful nutrition therapy.
Women with gestational diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes (a condition where the body doesn't use insulin properly); learning to manage gestational diabetes mellitus with lifestyle changes provides an opportunity to impact personal risk factors (such as health and fitness) and the health of the whole family.
