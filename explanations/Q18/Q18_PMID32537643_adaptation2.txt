To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

Lower carb diets may improve blood sugar but may increase blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women).
We presume that fairly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase blood ketone bodies.
To compare levels of blood ketone made from fat breakdown, risk of high blood ketone bodies, and pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes randomly given a lower carb diet or regular care.
Forty-six women around 33 years of age were randomly split at 28.5 weeks to either a modestly lower carb diet (MLC) or standard, routine care (RC) for 6 weeks.

There was no difference in blood ketones between those in the MLC diet group relative to the RC group, even though carb and total energy intake was lower in the diet group.
Only 20% in the MLC diet group met the goal intake versus the 65% in the RC group.
No differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-prenatal-age infants, percent fat mass, or fat-free mass between groups existed.
Reducing carb intake in those with gestational diabetes did not raise ketones made from fat breakdown, possibly because the carb target was difficult to achieve in pregnancy.
Feeding studies providing food may have to assess the effects of low-carb diets.
