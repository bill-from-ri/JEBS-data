To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

Group 1 of a study included all types of carbohydrates and followed the guidelines described by the American Dietetic Association, an organization of food and nutrition professionals, for gestational diabetes, a type of high blood sugar (diabetes) that develops during pregnancy in women who do not already have diabetes.
Women each receive a food plan based on limiting carbohydrates, using a method that counts carbohydrates.
Limiting the amount of calories and foods that generate energy consumed is recommend only for overweight or obese women.
Breakfast carbohydrates eaten is limited, and adequate fiber consumed is increased.
Women in this group are advised to choose any type of carbohydrate, except those with added refined sugars (processed sugars added to food).
Energy and carbohydrate prescriptions are revised at every visit, and changes are done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria (high ketones, which is a chemical made in the liver that helps break down fat, in urine) is present.
If ketones are present and weight gain is under the normal level, energy prescription is increased.
If weight gain is enough, energy is not modified, and carbohydrates are increased.
The recommendation for the amount of fat eaten stays the same, and the protein recommendation is adjusted accordingly.
Group 2 focused on carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (a rating system used to measure how much specific foods increase blood sugar levels). Women in this group have the same program as women in Group 1, but are guided to remove all moderate and high glycemic index foods.
Tropical fruits, refined (highly processed) breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars are eliminated from their plan.
Papaya was the only moderate glycemic index fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population.
Corn tortillas are included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, based on some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their glycemic index.
In conclusion, including low glycemic index carbohydrates as part of a well-rounded nutrition program is just as effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of carbohydrates.
This strategy has a positive effect in preventing too much maternal weight gain but increases the risk of prematurity (a baby born before 37 weeks).
