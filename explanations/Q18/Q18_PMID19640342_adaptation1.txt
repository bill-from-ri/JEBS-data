To treat abnormal ketones result of pregnant woman what food should be eaten?

Current controversies and arguments for nutrition therapy (treatment based on food) in pregnancies that are complicated by diabetes (a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy) include the amount of carbohydrates (carbs) and fats, the best amount of weight to gain during pregnancy, and the best way to limit calories.
There is little evidence for a recommended amount and type of carb or how it is distributed.
This lack of evidence creates a disagreement among health care providers over the type of carb and amount that should be eaten throughout the day.
The best measures at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood sugar, testing for ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), food diaries, and weight gain.
A review of the published studies provides the most current information available for medical nutrition therapy during a pregnancy complicated by diabetes. The review supports the need for further research to answer questions regarding carbohydrate changes and distribution in the diet, energy needs, and weight gain.
