How do you check for a hernia?

Internal hernias, bulging of digestive organs which cannot be seen from outside the body, are rare, and a delayed diagnosis can cause dangerous complications.
A 75-year-old man who had never had surgery had pain in the right upper stomach and vomiting.
He had tensing of the muscles in the right upper stomach with a physical exam test showing pain.
However, ultrasound of the gall bladder was normal with larger than normal bowel loops.
A CT scan showed a falciform hernia, caused by a weakening in the falciform ligament - or connecting tissue - of the liver, with signs of blockage.
The dead portion of the last part of the small intestine was removed with a temporary opening in the abdominal wall made during surgery.
Later on, the abdominal wall opening was reversed with no complications.
