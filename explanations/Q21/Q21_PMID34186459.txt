How do you check for a hernia?

Introduction and importance: A Littre's hernia (LH) is defined by the presence of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) in any kind of hernia sac.
Preoperative diagnosis of LH is a challenge because of its rarity and the absence of specific radiological findings and clinical presentation.
Surgery is the appropriate treatment of complicated LH that is an extremely rare condition with approximately 50 cases reported in the literature over the past 300 years.
Case presentation: A 46-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of abdominal pain.
Physical examination revealed an irreducible and painfull mass in umbilical region.
Abdominal computed tomography scan showed the protrusion of greater omentum and small bowel loop through the umbilical ring.
Laboratory tests were unremarkable.
After diagnosis of strangulated umbilical hernia, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy: the irreducible umbilical hernial sac was opened with presence of incarcerated and strangulated omentum and uncomplicated MD.
Resection of incarcerated and ischemic greater omentum alone was performed.
The postoperative course of patient was uneventful.
Clinical discussion: Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, representing the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract.
Preoperative diagnosis of LH is very difficult and surgery represents the correct treatment of complicated LH.
Conclusion: LH represents an extremely rare complication of MD difficult to diagnose and suspect because of the lack of specific radiological findings and clinical presentation.
Surgery represents the appropriate treatment of abdominal wall hernias and complicated MD.
