How do you check for a hernia?

Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine which diagnostic modality [Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US)] is more precise in terms of sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing inguinal hernia and sub-type of inguinal hernia (direct or indirect).
Results: Bubble charts depicting the size of each patient cohort and percentual range for both sensitivity and specificity showed that US was better than CT and MRI in diagnosing inguinal hernia.
Bubble charts for US and CT depicted high values within the studies that reported sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing type of hernia.
Conclusions: We found that US had the highest sensitivity and specificity.
However, it must be taken into consideration that performance is highly dependent on the operator's level of expertise.
Based on this systematic review, ultrasound may be the preferred imaging modality when physical examination is inconclusive, given that local expertise in performing US examination for hernia disease is adequate.
