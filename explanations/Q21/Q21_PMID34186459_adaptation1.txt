How do you check for a hernia?

A Littre's hernia (LH) is characterized by Meckel's diverticulum (MD; a pouch on the wall of the lower part of the small intestine present at birth) in any kind of hernia or bulging organ sac.
Diagnosing LH before surgery is difficult because it is rare and lacks distinguishing features on x-ray and exam.
Surgery is the best treatment for inflamed LH, a very rare condition with about 50 cases reported in scientific papers over the past 300 years.
A 46-year-old white woman went to the emergency room after two days of stomach pain.
Physical exam showed an irreversible and painful lump near the belly button.
Stomach CT scan showed the tissue that covers the intestines and loop of the small intestine pushing out through the muscle that surrounds the belly button.
Lab tests were normal.
After diagnosis of a hernia near the belly button cutting off blood supply, the patient had abdominal surgery. Doctors opened the irreversible hernia sac and saw tissue that covers the intestines trapped and cut off from blood supply along with uninflamed MD.
Parts of the tissue that covers the intestines that were trapped or cut off from blood supply and were removed.
The patient recovered normally from surgery.
MD is the most common abnormality of the GI tract present at birth.
Diagnosing LH before surgery is difficult and surgery is the best treatment of inflamed LH.
We conclude that LH is a very rare complication of MD and is difficult to diagnose because it lacks distinguishing features on x-ray and exam.
Surgery is the best treatment for stomach wall hernias and inflamed MD.
