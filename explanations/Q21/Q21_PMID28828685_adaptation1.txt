How do you check for a hernia?

Hiatal hernias, which occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest, are often found by x-ray and using a long, thin tube with a camera to look inside the body.
Hiatal hernias may cause symptoms or, less often, can become trapped or twisted, cutting off blood flow to organs.
This review looks at the latest studies on the diagnosis and treatment of hiatal hernias.
We reviewed the strongest current and most recent studies.
We studied this information and put it in an easily reviewable format.
We found that hiatal hernias without symptoms develop symptoms and need repair at a rate of 1% per year.
Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is suggested for people with hernias with no symptoms.
Hiatal hernias with symptoms and those with stomach acid reflux disease need surgery with an anti-reflux procedure.
Surgery has key steps.
When these key steps can't be done, stitching the stomach to the diaphragm and inserting a feeding tube is another option.
We conclude that hiatal hernias are often found when looking for something else.
When hernias cause symptoms or have reflux disease, surgery is needed.
A minimally invasive treatment is safe and has improved results.
