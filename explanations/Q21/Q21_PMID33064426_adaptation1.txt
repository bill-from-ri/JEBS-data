How do you check for a hernia?

Digestive organs (e.g., intestines) coming out through a weak point or tear in the abdomen causes groin hernias and includes inguinal (groin area) and femoral (upper thigh area) hernias.
Inguinal hernias happen more in men.
Although groin hernias are easily seen in a physical exam in men, ultrasound is often needed in women.
Ultrasound is also helpful when a doctor thinks a hernia has returned, there is a complication after surgery to repair the hernia, or there is another cause of pain (e.g., groin mass, fluid collection in the scrotum).
MRI has higher accuracy for detection and no detection than ultrasound and is useful for diagnosing hidden hernias if a doctor thinks it is hernia even if an ultrasound does not show one.
Injecting a substance into the hernia sac to improve visibility in x-rays may be used in some patients.
Learning about the common types of surgeries can help family doctors improve care after surgery and look for complications, including the hernia returning.
Minimally invasive repair has a shorter recovery time, earlier return to daily activities, less pain, and lower return rates than traditional repair.
Men with inguinal hernias and with few to no symptoms can reasonably and safely watch the hernia without treatment unless symptoms appear or change.
Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is not suggested in people with hernias with symptoms or in nonpregnant women.
