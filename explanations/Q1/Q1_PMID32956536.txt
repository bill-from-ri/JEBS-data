What causes muscle spasm?

Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or motor neuron disorders (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
Typically, such cramps have no obvious underlying pathology, and so are termed idiopathic.
Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear.
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012, and performed to identify and incorporate more recent studies.
