What causes muscle spasm?

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and occur with pregnancy, old age, exercise or nerve-related, movement disorders (like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which weakens muscles).
Usually, muscle cramps have no obvious cause.
Magnesium supplements are used for preventing cramps, but their effectiveness is unclear.
