What causes muscle spasm?

Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC) are a common type of muscle spasm, in which a muscle continually contracts without intention, causing pain.
Scientists have tried to explain why these cramps happen, but have not been able to.
An idea commonly returned to throughout the years is that EAMCs may be caused by heat.
Recently, though, more likely explanations are thought to include dehydration, lack of electrolytes, or issues with the nerves connecting to the muscles.
The aim of this review is to look at recent research into how and why EAMCs happen.
We searched common online resources for papers.
For search terms, we used: muscle cramps, neuromuscular hypothesis (or thesis), dehydration hypothesis, Exercise-Associated muscle cramps, nocturnal cramps, muscle spasm, muscle fatigue.
The search returned 424 papers. We read and analyzed 69 of them.
From the latest evidence, interactions of nerves with muscles explains muscle cramps better than dehydration.
Muscle contraction is normally balanced by special cells in the muscles that sense how stretched or contracted the muscles are. Recent findings suggest malfunctions in these sensor cells result in spinal nerves sending unnecessary signals for the muscles to contract.
In summary, the signal causing muscles to contract during a spasm seems to come from the spine rather than the nerve endings within the muscles.
