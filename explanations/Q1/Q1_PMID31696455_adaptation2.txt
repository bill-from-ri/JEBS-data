What causes muscle spasm?

Muscle cramp is a temporary but intense, painful, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can occur for different reasons.
The causes of and cures for exercise-related cramps remain unknown. However, some cases may be linked with disturbances of water and salt balance, while others may be from constant abnormal spinal reflex activity linked to fatigue of the affected muscles.
Evidence of lack of water comes largely from medical records from large industrial settings. However, it is also supported by one large treatment trial and trials with small groups of athletes.
Cramp is very unpredictable, making lab studies difficult, but experiments with electrical stimulation or intense voluntary contractions of small muscles held in a shortened position can cause cramp in many, but not all, individuals.
These studies show that dehydration does no affect the stimulation amount needed to start cramping and confirm a role for spinal pathways, but their link to the spontaneous exercise-related cramps that occur is questionable.
There is a long history of home remedies for treatment or prevention of cramps. Some may reduce the chance of some forms of cramping and reduce its intensity and length, but none are consistently effective.
There may be different types of cramp caused by different mechanisms; if so, finding a single strategy for prevention or treatment is unlikely to work.
