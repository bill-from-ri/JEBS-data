What causes muscle spasm?

Muscle cramps are a common problem represented by sudden, painful, involuntary muscle contractions.
These true cramps, coming from nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, may be identifiable from other muscle pains.
Medical history, physical check-up, and lab screenings help determine different causes of muscle cramps.
Despite their harmless nature, cramps are uncomfortable for many.
Experience and limited medical studies guide treatment.
Quinine sulfate (an antimalarial drug) helps, but its side-effects are problematic. Similar drugs may be just as helpful.
More studies are needed to better define the effects of muscle cramps and find better medications.
