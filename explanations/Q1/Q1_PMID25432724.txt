What causes muscle spasm?

The dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures and/or repetitive movements.
A careful assessment of the clinical manifestations is helpful for identifying syndromic patterns that focus diagnostic testing on potential causes.
If a cause is identified, specific etiology-based treatments may be available.
In most cases, a specific cause cannot be identified, and treatments are based on symptoms.
Treatment options include counseling, education, oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, and several surgical procedures.
A substantial reduction in symptoms and improved quality of life is achieved in most patients by combining these options.
