What causes muscle spasm?

Muscle cramps cause constant and unintended contraction of muscles, causing pain. They can occur for individual muscles, groups of muscles, or small parts of muscles.
A cramp usually lasts seconds or minutes, regardless of cause and how healthy you are.
A knot (hard area) can be felt beneath the skin where the cramp is.
Muscle cramps are the most common reason for seeking medical help during sports.
We still don't know why muscle cramps happen. Causes may also depend on the person and the situation.
Importantly, even though the pain of a muscle cramp can be in a specific area, the cause may lie elsewhere.
A cramp can almost never be explained just by local effects, and it involves both the whole body and your emotional state.
