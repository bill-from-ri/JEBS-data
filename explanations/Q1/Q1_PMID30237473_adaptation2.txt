What causes muscle spasm?

Dystonia is a disorder of the nervous system. It involves unusual posture or parts of your body moving in ways you can't control.
Dystonia could be a sign of many underlying disorders, sometimes with other symptoms and sometimes not.
We will focus on dystonia without other symptoms. This can be hereditary or have an unknown origin.
Dystonia varies in how it appears, but it can affect all age groups, and can significantly impact daily life.
We understand more about different types of dystonia since discovering the genes causing it.
Some of the most common forms of hereditary dystonia are caused by mutations in genes called TOR1A, THAP1, GCH1 and KMT2B. These mutations may cause: problems with genes turning on or off; problems with sending or receiving dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in motivation); problems adjusting the connections of brain cells; or problems suppressing unwanted brain activity.
Dystonia is mainly diagnosed by signs a doctor can recognize. It is still difficult to diagnose and explain dystonia.
Dystonia can be treated with: drugs (specifically anticholinergics, which block a neurotransmitter); injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox); and insertion of electrodes into the brain. However, we hope that more research will produce better diagnostics, treatments, and maybe cures.
