How often can i get a covid-19 vaccine?

The BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer) is highly effective against COVID-19 infection. In registration studies, the two doses were delivered 3 weeks apart..
However, many countries extended the time between the first and second doses to maximize the number of people vaccinated with one dose.
It is not known how antibody responses or cellular immune responses are influenced by delaying the second dose.
We studied the immune response in the first 14 weeks after the standard 3-week interval or the extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. We showed that delaying the second dose strongly boosts the peak antibody response by 3.5-fold in older people.
This enhanced antibody response may offer a longer period of protection against infection and delay the need for booster vaccination.
In contrast, peak cellular-specific responses were the strongest in those vaccinated on a standard 3-week vaccine interval.
The timing of the second dose has a strong influence on the antibody response after BNT162b2 vaccination in older people.
