How often can i get a covid-19 vaccine?

After vaccination with the 2-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, blood levels of antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 drop over time. To increase blood levels of antibodies again, the FDA approved a booster dose for people greater than 12 years old.
However, limited data exist on whether a booster dose of the mRNA vaccine results in greater antibody protection than the primary series.
We measured the blood levels of all types of antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and a specific type of antibodies - called neutralizing antibodies - against Washington-1 and other variants of concern including Beta, Delta and Omicron. We followed the trends in antibody levels at several points in time after vaccination.
Healthcare workers were included in the analysis if serum was collected within 14-44 days post-dose 2 of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, or at least 8 months post-dose 2, or within 14-44 days following an mRNA booster shot.
Healthcare workers who had previously tested positive to COVID-19 were excluded from this study.
We found that there are few to no neutralizing antibodies produced against the omicron variant following a 2-dose mRNA vaccine series. By 8-months post two-dose vaccination series, no neutralizing antibodies remain in blood circulation.
However, the mRNA booster reactivates immunity to the omicron variant after the two-dose vaccination.
Neutralizing antibody blood levels were significantly higher for all variants post-booster compared to the levels after the first two shots.
The long-term nature of our study helped us to analyze the trends of antibody blood levels over time. We saw a 15-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant following the booster shot.
An mRNA booster dose provides greater quantity and quality of antibodies compared to a two-dose vaccine and is critical to provide any protection against the omicron variant.
