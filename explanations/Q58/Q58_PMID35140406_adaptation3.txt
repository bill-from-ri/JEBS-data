How often can i get a covid-19 vaccine?

We are interested in studying the waning effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the effectiveness of booster doses.
Using national Brazilian databases, we studied the trends of negative test results of almost 14 million people (representing about 16 million tests) to estimate the reduced effectiveness of CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccines over time. We also studied the effects of the Pfizer BNT162b2 booster dose on the rates of confirmed COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death).
Compared with unvaccinated individuals, the effectiveness of the CoronaVac vaccine at 14-30 days after the second dose was 55% against confirmed infection and 82.1% against severe outcomes.
Vaccine effectiveness decreased to 34.7% against infection and 72.5% against severe outcomes over 180 days after the second dose.
A Pfizer BNT162b2 booster shot given 6 months after the second dose of CoronaVac, improved vaccine effectiveness by 92.7% against infection and 97.3% against severe outcomes 14-30 days after the booster.
Compared with younger age groups, individuals 80 years of age or older had lower protection after the second dose but similar protection after the booster.
Based on these results, we recommend a BNT162b2 booster vaccine dose after two doses of CoronaVac, particularly for the elderly.
