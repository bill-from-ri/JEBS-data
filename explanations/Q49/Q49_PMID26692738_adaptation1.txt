What causes pitted edema in legs?

A 46 year old male with past medical history of schizoaffective (reality-distorting) disorder, a mental disorder, and chronic lower back pain, is admitted to a medical facility to manage worsening depression and anxiety.
He is started on a medicine called gabapentin (nerve pain medication) for his back pain and anxiety symptoms.
His only other medication is an opioid pain reliever called hydrocodone.
Over the next few days, he starts developing worsening edema, swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues, in both legs.
He does not have any cardiovascular (heart) related symptoms.
A physical exam found pitting edema, where pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. All other lab tests and imaging scans did not show anything significant.
Gabapentin is stopped and the swelling in his legs improved over the following days.
In other studies, the occurrence of swollen feet (pedal edema) while on gabapentin is about 7 to 7.5% in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day.
This case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this negative effect.
It is important to recognize this negative effect because gabapentin is used in conditions like nerve damage common with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), which is associated with multiple illnesses that can give rise to swelling in both legs.
