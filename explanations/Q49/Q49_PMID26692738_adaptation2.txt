What causes pitted edema in legs?

We admitted a 46 year old male to treat his worsening depression and anxiety. He had a prior history of symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders and long-lasting lower back pain.
He was started on gabapentin (nerve pain medication), 300 mg twice daily for his back pain and anxiety symptoms.
His only other medication was hydrocodone, a pain and cough medication.
Over the next few days, he developed worsening swelling in both legs.
He did not have any heart-related symptoms.
Physical exam only noted serious swelling with all lab values and imaging not being serious.
Gabapentin use was stopped, and his leg swelling improved over the next few days.
Frequency of leg swelling with gabapentin use is around 7 to 7.5% with all studies being in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day.
This case shows that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this harmful effect.
This serious effect should be noted since gabapentin is used in conditions like diabetic nerve pain, which is linked with other diseases that can give rise to swelling in both legs.
Presence of gabapentin-caused leg swelling can thus confuse the diagnosis.
