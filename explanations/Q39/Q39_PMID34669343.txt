What is a biomarker?

This literature review focuses on the role of disease biomarkers in the management of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) investigating in detail the problem of retinal neurodegeneration in such patients.
Identification and assessment of the significance of qualitative and quantitative biomarkers of DR and neurodegeneration can complement screening examination, as well as help predict the course of the disease and the response to therapy.
A comprehensive analysis of these factors allows for effective treatment and prevention of complications in patients with DR based on prognostic models and dynamic monitoring of these indicators.
