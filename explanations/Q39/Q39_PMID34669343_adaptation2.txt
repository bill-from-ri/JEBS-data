What is a biomarker?

This review article focuses on the role of biological disease markers in treating patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), or eye diseases from diabetes. The article also investigates how nerve cells in the eye die in these patients.
Evaluating the importance of non-measurable and measurable disease markers of DR and nerve cell degeneration can help disease detection, prediction, and treatment.
An analysis of these markers allows for effective treatment and prevention of health hazards in patients with DR based on measuring and monitoring these markers.
