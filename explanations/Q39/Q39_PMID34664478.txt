What is a biomarker?

Among the many complications associated with pregnancy, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) constitute one of the most important.
Since the pathophysiology of HDP is complex, new disease biomarkers (DBMs) are needed to serve as indicators of disease activity.
However, in the current status of laboratory medicine, despite the fact that blood pressure measurement has been used for a long time, not many DBMs contribute adequately to the subsequent diagnosis and treatment.
In this article, we discuss studies focusing on peptide fragments in blood identified by comprehensive quantitative methods, among the currently proposed DBM candidates.
Furthermore, we describe the basic techniques of peptidomics, especially quantitative proteomics, and outline the current status and challenges of measuring peptides in blood as DBM for HDP.
