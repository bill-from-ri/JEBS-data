What is a biomarker?

Detecting chemical compounds in exhaled human breath may help determine health status, identify disease, or measure environmental exposure.
Recent advances in research of small energy molecules (metabolomics) led to better methods to explore human health status in breath.
Despite some methodological challenges, exhaled breath is a desirable tool for metabolomics due to its non-surgery, convenient, and limitless availability.
Many breath-based tests that target internal or external gas compounds are established and used in practice.
This review outlines the concept of breath analysis regarding these unique breath-based tests and their applications.
The breath biological disease markers in each test are discussed based on their production in humans and development and use of the associated tests.
The paper ends with a short look into future tests and direction of breath research.
