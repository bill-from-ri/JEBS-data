What is a biomarker?

Increased expression of β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and tau proteins are considered risk-factors for Alzheimer's disease in healthy older adults. Aβ1-42 is a protein deposited in organs, clumps referred to as plaques, during certain diseases. Tau proteins are proteins that stabilizes microtubules or structures within cells.
This paper investigated the effect of aging and cerebrospinal (brain and spine) fluid levels of Aβ1-42 and tau on two health endpoints. These endpoints include evaluating frontal metabolites with a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and cognition (thinking ability) in cognitively normal older adults.
Levels of a neurotransmitter (a signaling molecule) known as gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA+) were predicted by age. Levels of myo-inositol relative to creatine (mI/tCr), a ratio of two metabolites in the brain often used to determine disease state, were predicted by age.
Levels of GABA+ predicted cognitive performance better than mI/tCr.
Additionally, frontal levels of n-acetyl aspartate, another brain metabolite, relative to creatine (tNAA/tCr) were predicted by levels of t-tau, the protein.
In cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal GABA+ and mI/t Cr are predicted by aging. Levels of GABA+ decreased with age. Levels of mI/tCr increased with age.
These results suggest that age- and biomarker-related changes in brain metabolites are not only located in the posterior cortex. Additionally, these studies demonstrate that MRS is a viable tool to study aging and aging biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease.
