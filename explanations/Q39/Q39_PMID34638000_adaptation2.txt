What is a biomarker?

Increased amounts of β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and tau, biological proteins, are considered risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in healthy, older adults.
We tested the effect of aging and Aβ1-42 and tau amounts in brain and spine fluid on 1) energy molecules in the front of the brain and 2) reasoning skills in 144 older adults.
Levels of specific chemical signal molecules (GABA+) and sugars (mI/tCr) in the brain were linked to age.
Levels of the GABA+ trended with reasoning skills better than Mi/tCr.
We found that levels of a specific chemical molecule were linked to levels of t-tau.
In normal older adults, the specific chemical signal molecule GABA+ decreased with age while the chemical sugar mI/tCR increased with age.
Age- and biomarker-related changes in brain molecules are not only located in the back of the brain as other studies show and that using a radio-wave tool can help study aging and biomarkers linked with aging diseases and Alzheimer's.
