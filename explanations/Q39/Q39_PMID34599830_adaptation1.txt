What is a biomarker?

Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator (regulator) in diseases occurring with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), such as Marfan syndrome (MFS). Thoracic aortic aneurysm is characterized by an abnormal bulge in the blood vessel.
The progressive dilation, or widening, of the aorta (the largest human artery) in TAA ultimately leads to aortic dissection. This is a tear in the inner layer of the blood artery.
Unfortunately, current medical treatments neither halt aortic enlargement nor prevent rupture. This leaves surgical repair as the only effective treatment.
There is a need for effective therapies to delay or even avoid the need for surgical repair in TAA patients.
This paper summarizes the ways NO signaling dysregulation (or dysfunction) causes TAA, particularly in MFS. Additionally, this paper will discuss recent advances on the identification of new MFS mediators that represent potential biomarkers. Biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient.
The authors propose several biological substances as targets for therapeutic intervention in TAA and candidates for clinical trials.
