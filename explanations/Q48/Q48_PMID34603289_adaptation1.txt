I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a common autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. It is unclear how the disease develops.
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) are cells that are present in adult bone marrow and the umbilical cord, and extracellular vesicles released from MSC cells are particles that carry molecules, proteins and other substances between cells.  These play important roles in regulating natural immunity and immunity acquired after exposure to a virus or to bacteria, which are involved in many disease development processes.
The effects of MSC cells and extracellular vesicles on lupus have been drawing more and more attention during the past few years.
This article reviews the changes in the body's immune system and underlying process of MSC and extracellular vesicles in lupus, which provides new insight into understanding the disease development of lupus and guiding therapy.
