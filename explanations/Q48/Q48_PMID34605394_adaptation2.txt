I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

The study aimed to determine the relative success and safety of belimumab and anifrolumab, common immunosuppressive drugs, for patients with full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more.
An analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the success and safety of belimumab 10 mg, anifrolumab 300 mg, and a dummy treatment in patients with active SLE.
Six studies (2,757 patients) were analyzed.
Patient health at 52 weeks was much higher in the belimumab 10-mg and anifrolumab 300-mg groups than the dummy treatment group.
Patient health for the belimumab 10 mg group was higher than that for the anifrolumab 300 mg group.
Based on the analysis, belimumab 10 mg was most likely the best treatment, followed by anifrolumab 300 mg, and the sham treatment.
The number of harmful side effects did not differ among the 4 treatment groups.
Based on patient health measures, belimumab 10 mg had the best success, followed by anifrolumab 10 mg.
However, there was no difference in the number of harmful side effects among treatment options.
