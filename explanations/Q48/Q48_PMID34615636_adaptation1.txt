I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Clinical trials studying the infection-fighting antibodies called rituximab and ocrelizumab failed to show benefit in severe cases of lupus nephritis, a kidney disease caused by lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells).
Obinutuzumab is an antibody that reduces B-cells, a type of protein that produces antibodies but also associated with diseases such as lupus. Researchers compared obinutuzumab with a placebo (inactive substance that looks like a medicine) for the treatment of lupus nephritis in combination with standard therapies.
Patients with lupus nephritis receiving standard treatments such as steroids are randomly put in a group to either receive obinutuzumab or a placebo. The drug or placebo are given on day 1 and weeks 2, 24 and 26, and followed through week 104.
The  main result is complete kidney response at week 52.
Additional analyses through week 104 are also done.
A total of 125 patients are randomly placed into either the obinutuzumab or the placebo group and did not know which group they are in.
Achievement of complete kidney response is greater with obinutuzumab at week 52  and at week 104.
Improvements in other kidney and blood tests are greater with obinutuzumab.
Obinutuzumab is not associated with increases in serious negative events, serious infections or deaths.
Reactions related to the infusion (injection) occurred more frequently with obinutuzumab but are not serious reactions.
In conclusion, improved kidney responses through week 104 are observed in patients with lupus nephritis who received obinutuzumab plus standard treatment compared with standard treatments alone.
Patients were able to tolerate side effects of obinutuzumab, and no new safety issues were identified.
