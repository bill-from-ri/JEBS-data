I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Successfully treating patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) is limited by the different causes, its presence in multiple organs and systems, and a complex immune response.
Treatments that target certain inflammatory (infection-fighting) processes in the body may be needed for some patients.
One such target is the type I interferon pathway, a specific immune system pathway.
Type I interferons increase the production of interferon genes (genes that allow communication between cells to activate the immune system) and brings about critical immune responses to fight viruses.
Problems with the signaling in type I interferons are found in patients with lupus, and the extent of the problem is connected to how serious the disease is, making type I interferons possible targets for treatment.
The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody medicine, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with lupus shows the value of targeting this pathway.
Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has multiple cells and signaling parts that are not completely understood.
Understanding the type I interferon pathway and how it relates to lupus will be valuable for future development of lupus treatments.
This review summarizes the immune process of the interferon pathway, its association with disease development, and therapeutic methods that target problems interferon pathway.
