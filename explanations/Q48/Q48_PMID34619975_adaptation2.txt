I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Metformin, an anti-diabetic medication, may treat full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more.
The primary target of metformin, a specific energy-generator in the cell, is linked with electrical balance in immune cells, which influence the creation of diseases in which immune cells mistakely attack healthy cells.
This article reviews the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether metformin's beneficial effects in lupus may be due to a restored, balanced electrical state.
Clinical trials in SLE patients with mild to moderate disease severity and mice studies show encouraging results for metformin.
How this beneficial effect is achieved is largely unknown.
Metformin monitors electrical balance depending on the situation.
Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased cellular stress in certain immune cells called T cells and neutrophils.
The major knowledge gaps are whether the success of metformin is linked to a restored electrical balance in the immune system. If it does, in which cell types it occurs?
We also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and if it corresponds to a specfic biological process?
Finally, identifying markers to predict treatment outcomes would be very useful.
