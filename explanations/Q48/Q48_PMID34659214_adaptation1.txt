I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a type of chronic autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues.
The mechanisms and processes of how lupus develops remain unclear.
Therefore, effective therapies with low side effects for lupus are lacking.
Recently, therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), cells that are present in adult bone marrow and umbilical cords, for diseases including lupus has gained increasing attention.
This therapy can improve the signs and symptoms of lupus by promoting the development of Th2 and Treg cells that are involved in activating the immune system and slowing the activity of other cells that are overactive in cases of lupus (Th1, Th17, and B cells, etc.).
However, MSC therapy is also reported ineffective in some patients with lupus, which may be related to the stem cells or patient's factors.
Therefore, the treatment effects of MSCs should be further confirmed.
This review summarizes the status of MSC therapy in lupus treatment and potential reasons for the ineffectiveness of MSC therapy from three perspectives.
Researchers suggest various changes in MSC methods that may be beneficial in slowing the immune effect of MSCs in lupus.
However, their safety and protective effects in patients with lupus still need to be confirmed by more evidence.
