I have lupus. What can i do to stop it?

Using data from clinical trials, the study aimed to describe how anifrolumab, an immunosuppressive drug, operates effectively and safely in patients with moderate to severe full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, under standard treatment.
We analyzed two randomized, 52-week trials, called TULIP-1 and TULIP-2, which involved injected anifrolumab treatment (every 4 weeks for 48 weeks).
To track patient health, we used specific assessments along with measurements of average anifrolumab blood concetration (Cave) to compare anifrolumab-treated patients, sham-treatment patients, patients who completed treatment, and patients with increased immune-specific genetic markers.
Trends between health and key safety events were assessed graphically.
Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who got anifrolumab (91 received 150 mg, 356 received 300 mg) or sham treatment (366 patients), 574 completed treatment, of whom 470 had high levels of immune-specific molecules.
Patient health favored anifrolumab 300 mg vs dummy treatment across all analuzed populations.
Higher anifrolumab levels were linked to greater treatment success.
There was no evidence of treatment-related safety events through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg.
Whil higher anifrolumab levels predicted greater success, consistent positive benefit favouring anifrolumab 300 mg vs dummy treatment was seen across assessments in subgroups of the TULIP trials.
There was no evidence of treatment-related safety events.
