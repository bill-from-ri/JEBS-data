Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

Buspirone hydrochloride (HCL)1 is a new anti-anxiety drug with a unique molecular makeup.
How it works is not yet fully understood.
Unlike benzodiazepines, another type of drug to treat anxiety, buspirone is “anxioselective”; that is, it relieves anxiety without the side effects of benzodiazepines (sedation and muscle relaxation).
As shown by a few clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety using a standard questionnaire similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam - other drugs that treat anxiety.
Like diazepam, buspirone works in patients with anxiety and depression, although the number of patients studied is small.
In many studies, it takes 1 to 2 weeks for anxiety relief after starting buspirone, so doctors may need to encourage patients to keep taking buspirone.
Sedation happens much less often with buspirone than benzodiazepines, and other side effects are mild and uncommon.
In healthy people, buspirone does not decrease mental processes and physical movement, and seems to not change with drinking alcohol.
Early studies suggest buspirone is not likely to be abused or cause dependence.
Although only more people taking buspirone for longer will show exactly how it works, it is another option to treat generalized anxiety because it rarely causes sedation.
It could become the top treatment in patients who must be alert during the day.
