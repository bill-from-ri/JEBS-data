Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

A drug interaction is when other things change the usual effects of a drug, most often other drugs.
When two drugs are taken at the same time, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can happen that may change the size or length of the effect of one or both drugs.
Drugs may interact based on what the drugs do to each other (pharmaceutical), what the body does to the drugs (pharmacokinetic), and what the drugs do to the body (pharmacodynamic).
Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the change in effect happens at the site the drug works at in the body.
Phamacodynamics is a wide field.
Pharmacodynamic interactions can cause drugs to work together or against each other and can happen at different levels of the body.
Drugs that affect the mind, emotions, and behavior measured through a well known tool for finding and characterizing drug effects on the central nervous system (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) can be used based on the aim of the study: safety (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), drug properties (benzodiazepine receptors), or brain function (diazepam/buspirone).
We focus on methods, especially drug blood levels, response as a function of dosage, and varying activity of the drug over time (fluoxetine/buspirone) and talk about unsolved questions.
