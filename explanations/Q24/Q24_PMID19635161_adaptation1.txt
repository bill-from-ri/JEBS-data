Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

Many drugs often used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been labeled "potentially inappropriate" for use in patients 65-years-old and above because they may cause more risks than benefits.
However, it is not known how often these drugs are given to patients.
From a database of patients in Germany, we identified all patients 65-years-old and above with GAD who had seen a primary care doctor or received a prescription between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004.
Among drugs to treat GAD (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], SSRIs, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, some short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, some TCAs, and hydroxyzine were categorized "potentially inappropriate" for people 65-years-old and above.
We looked at 975 elderly patients with GAD.
Average age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% were also diagnosed with depression.
Forty percent of people in the study were given inappropriate anxiety-treating drugs - most often, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%).
Twenty-three percent of people in the study were given long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% were given short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% were given TCAs categorized as potentially inappropriate.
We conclude that German doctors often prescribe drugs labeled as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD, especially those also diagnosed with depression.
More research is needed to understand whether certain groups of elderly patients with GAD exist with whom the benefits outweigh the risks of these drugs.
