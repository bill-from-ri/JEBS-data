Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

Over 10 weeks, we compared the anti-anxiety drug characteristics of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and sugar pills in 125 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
After a 3- to 7-day period for the body to eliminate drugs in the system, patients were randomly given 5 mg buspirone 3 times a day (58 patients), 1 mg lorazepam 3 times a day (57 patients), or sugar pills (10 patients) for four weeks.
The study also included a 2-week period when drug amounts were slowly decreased and a 4-week period when all patients took sugar pills to measure the consistency of improvements in anxiety symptoms.
Doctors estimated severity of anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the study and weekly using common questionnaires.
Patients taking lorazepam showed slightly greater improvement in symptoms than those taking buspirone on one of the questionnaires during the whole treatment (weeks 0-4) and when drug amounts were slowly decreased (weeks 5,6), though not significantly.
After patients stopped taking the studied drugs, the 4-week period when patients took sugar pills showed patients who took buspirone showed consistent improvements in anxiety symptoms, while patients who took lorazepam showed worse symptoms at weeks 7-10.
Both buspirone and lorazepam worked better than sugar pills to improve anxiety symptoms during treatment and when drug amounts were slowly decreased. However, patients who took sugar pills showed improvements in anxiety symptoms when all patients took sugar pills, especially in one questionnaire, so differences between sugar pills and drugs became smaller at the end of the study.
