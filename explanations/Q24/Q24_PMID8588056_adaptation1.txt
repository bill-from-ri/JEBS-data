Can you take lorazepam and buspirone at the same time?

This study's purpose was to compare the effects and sudden termination of buspirone 15 or 20 mg three times a day and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg three times a day, common anxiety-reducing drugs.
We included 43 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder in the study, and 39 quickly stopped taking medication.
We collected information from patients at the beginning of the study, at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks (active phase), and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase).
These assessments included common questionnaires measuring severity of anxiety symptoms.
Results show lorazepam and buspirone worked similarly well during the active phase with one questionnaire favoring buspirone for physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., fatigue).
No withdrawal symptoms were seen for both lorazepam and buspirone using one of the questionnaires, and the same significant difference was seen using another questionnaire.
This study showed that buspirone worked as well as lorazepam 56 days into the study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder.
Some results suggest that lorazepam and buspirone did not work the same against the physical symptoms seen in generalized anxiety disorder.
