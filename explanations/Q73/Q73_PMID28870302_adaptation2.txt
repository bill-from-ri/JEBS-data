In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Hip and knee replacement surgery is associated with significant pain around the time of the procedure. This can make recovery worse by increasing the risk of additional problems, length of stay, and cost.
Historically, opioids were the main way to control pain around the time of surgery.
However, opioids are associated with significant downsides.
Using several pain treatments at once (called multimodal pain management) before pain starts has become the standard way to manage pain after hip and knee replacement.
Multimodal pain management uses drugs taken by mouth, injections into nerves, injections into joints, and other tools to reduce the need for opioids.
Using several treatments at once promises to decrease additional problems, improve outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction after hip and knee replacement.
