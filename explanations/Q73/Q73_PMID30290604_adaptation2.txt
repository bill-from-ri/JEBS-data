In adult patients with total hip replacements how effective is pain medication in recovery?

Total Hip Replacement (THR) and Total Knee Replacement (TKR) are painful surgical procedures, especially TKR.
Managing pain well after surgery leads to gaining back function better and earlier and prevents chronic pain.
Studies on the control of pain during the rehabilitation period after surgery are not common.
The goal of this study is to present results of a protocol for anesthesia at the time of surgery, and a pain treatment protocol in use in the Orthopaedic and the Rehabilitation intensive units of our Hospital.
This study looked at outcomes from past procedures without intervening. It included 100 patients, 50 that had THR and 50 that had TKR.
From the medical records, we looked at the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain for all patients. We analyzed this pain measurement with respect to the spinal anaesthesia given for the surgery, local anaesthesia, and the regimen of pain medicine used in the Orthopaedic Unit after the surgery. We also analyzed the pain ratings with respect to pain medicine given while in the Rehabilitation Unit, additional pain medication given as needed because of more intense pain, and any side effects of the pain treatment.
Patients reached normal function (walking at least 50 meters and climbing/descending stairs) in 8 days on average without medication-related side effects.

How much extra pain medicine was used to address more intense pain during rehabilitation was correlated with how pain was recorded on the NRS.
Pain was controlled very well with the protocols for anesthesia at the time of surgery and pain treatment.
