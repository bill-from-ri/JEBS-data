How is diabetes diagnosed?

An international committee recommends diagnosing diabetes if hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), an iron-rich blood protein joined to a sugar, is at or over 6.5% with multiple tests.
The committee recommends not "mixing different methods to diagnose diabetes" because "the tests are not completely concordant [or consistent]: using different tests could easily lead to confusion".
Fasting blood sugar tests and blood sugar tests after simple sugar intake may help identify diabetes only if testing for HbA1c is not possible.
HbA1c testing is useful for greater convenience, accuracy, and uniformity, but as the single tool for identification, it may lead to measurement errors.
Unknown factors may alter scores of the iron-rich blood protein relative to the actual blood sugar level.
Thus, tests for this iron-rich blood protein connected to a sugar should be combined with other blood sugar values for diabetes identification.
If a score for HbA1c disagrees with the general reading, blood sugar testing should be performed.
A cut-off point at or over 6.5% for HbA1c misses many with type 2 diabetes, high fasting blood sugar, and impaired blood sugar sensitivity.
Using tests for HbA1c and blood sugar measurements identifies diabetes better than HbA1c tests alone.
