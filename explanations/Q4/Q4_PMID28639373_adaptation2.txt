How is diabetes diagnosed?

The objective of this study was to compare the use of hemoglobin A1C (a simple blood sugar test) to oral (by-mouth) glucose sensitivity (tolerance) testing to diagnose before-birth type 2 diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy.
The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the use of the hemoglobin A1C test results to oral glucose tolerance test results.
The study's methods included a sample of 45 women at high risk for type 2 diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Participants volunteered to draw a hemoglobin A1C with their oral glucose tolerance testing for comparison of the two tests' ability to diagnose type 2 diabetes.
For the study's results, hemoglobin A1C tests were highly linked with oral glucose tolerance testing for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in women in the first trimester of pregnancy.
In conclusion, the research provides beginning evidence that the hemoglobin A1C should be considered as an important diagnostic test for before-birth type 2 diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy.
