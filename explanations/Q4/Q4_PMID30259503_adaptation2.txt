How is diabetes diagnosed?

The study's introduction states that the maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare form of single-gene-causing diabetes.
Being clinically and genetically diverse, it is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to inappropriate therapy.
MODY is caused by a single gene mutation.
Thirteen genes, defining 13 types, have been identified to cause MODY.
A correct diagnosis is important for the right therapy, recovery, and genetic counselling.
The study's material and methods include twenty-nine unrelated child patients clinically suspected of having MODY diabetes analysed with DNA sequencing.
As the results in this study, we identified different types in MODY genes in 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%).
Using two genetic tests termed NGS and MLPA, we detected both small mutation types and large gene deletions in patients.
Most patients had a different type in the GCK gene (11/22), followed by HNF1B (5/22).
The rest of the different types were found in the NEUROD1 and HNF1A genes.
We identified one novel gene type in the GCK gene.
The applied genetic tests excluded the suspected diagnosis of MODY in two patients and revealed subtypes in other genes possibly linked with the patient's clinical physical characteristics.
In conclusion, in our group of MODY patients, most gene types were found in the GCK gene, followed by changes in HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF1A genes.
The combined genetic tests presented a comprehensive way to analyze patients with possible MODY diabetes and provided a successful diagnosis of MODY subtypes.
