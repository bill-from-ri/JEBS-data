How is diabetes diagnosed?

In 1997 the American Diabetes Association lowered the threshold for diagnosis of diabetes from a fasting (having not eaten food recently) blood glucose (sugar) level of 7.8 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l and advised that the by-mouth glucose tolerance test no longer be used in regular clinical practice.
In 1999 the World Health Organization supported the reduction in fasting blood glucose threshold but recommended keeping the by-mouth glucose tolerance test for anyone with affected fasting glucose (6.1 mmol/l-6.9 mmol/l).
This Review discusses the effect of these changes on the prevalance of diabetes and checks how it affects individuals and specific high-risk groups.
The physical effects of those identified with diabetes and the predictive value for the development of side effects according to the different criteria are compared.
It is clear that these changes in identification criteria have major importance both for individuals and for planning at a national level.
