How is diabetes diagnosed?

Standards of diagnosing diabetes in children have not been established with nearly the same precision as has been used in adults
Recently revised American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines uses the standard of  ≥ 6.5 % in the HbA1c test as a diagnosis of diabetes.
Recent studies in children show that the HbA1c test is not as accurate as other tests that measure glucose in the blood.
However, other glucose measuring blood tests have not yet been verified to work in children.
Future studies, to see which glucose measuring test is best in children, are unlikely to happen.
Accepting the ADA guidelines for diagnosing diabetes in children appears to be the best option for pediatricians.
Future studies on blood glucose tests should try to develop a guideline for doctors to treat ‘pre-diabetes’. 
However, such treatment, and the best way to diagnose and treat ’pre-diabetes’, has not been proven.
