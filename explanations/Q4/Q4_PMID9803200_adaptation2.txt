How is diabetes diagnosed?

New recommendations for classifying diabetes mellitus include using "type 1" and "type 2" instead of "IDDM" and "NIDDM" to identify the two major types of diabetes mellitus; simplifying the criteria for identifying diabetes mellitus to two unusual fasting blood scores; and a lower cutoff for fasting plasma glucose or blood sugar.
These changes help improve identification of those at risk from effects of high blood sugar.
Currently, only half of those with diabetes mellitus have been identified.
Testing for diabetes mellitus should begin at 45 years of age and be repeated every three years in those without health risks. Testing should begin earlier and more often for those with health risks.
Health risks include obesity, first-degree relatives with diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood fat, or prior signs of blood sugar imbalance.
Earlier detection of diabetes mellitus may improve blood sugar control and health issues from the disease.
