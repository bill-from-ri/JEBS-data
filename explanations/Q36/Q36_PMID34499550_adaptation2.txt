I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) is a tool to remove a variety of stones including: large kidney stones > 2 cm, lower kidney stones > 1 cm, kidney stones unaffected by shockwaves or surgical extraction, stones in complex tubes transporting urine, and large, unchanged stones causing inflammation in tubes carrying urine.
After lying down, an open-ended tube to collect urine, device to collect stone fragments, or device to block escape of stone framgents is inserted into the urine tube.
A thin tube is placed in the bladder to drain pee.
Guided sound waves are used to explore the kidney and reach the urine-collecting system with an 18 g surgical needle.
Once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin cut is made and the opening is enlarged with wires.
A metallic or self-enlarging vacuum is placed with x-ray guidance.
A rigid, small tube with a lens is used to explore the urine-collecting system.
Once a stone is observed, options for breaking it up include using a device with sound waves and bullet energy, or special laser.
Using a tube with a scope can ensure full removal from the urine-collecting system.
A tube to keep the urine flowing can be placed against or with urine flow for drainage.
The opening is sealed with a special surgical sealant.
The accompanying video (Supplementary Video S1) shows guidelines for care after surgery and troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL along with the actual surgery.
There are a few trials comparing mini-PCNL with the standard treatment option.
There may be a difference in urine transfer rates between mini- and standard PCNL. There may also be differences in stone-free rates between mini-PCNL and the standard treatment of lower kidney stones.
