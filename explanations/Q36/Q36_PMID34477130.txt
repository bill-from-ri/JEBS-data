I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Background: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with renal and upper ureteric stones.
Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
The eligible RCTs were selected from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library.
The reference lists of retrieved studies were also investigated.
Results: Our analysis included 10 RCTs with 1612 patients.
Pooled data from 10 RCTs revealed the following: stone-free rate (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.12,1.88], P = .004), operative time (mean difference [MD] = 4.10, 95% CI [-1.37,9.56], P = .14), length of hospital stay (MD = -15.31, 95% CI [-29.43,-1.19], P = .03), hemoglobin decrease (MD = -0.86, 95% CI [-1.19,-0.53], P < .00001), postoperative fever (MD = 0.83, 95% CI [0.49,1.40], P = .49), and urine leakage (MD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.25,1.37], P = .22).
Besides, we performed sub-group analysis based on vacuum suction effect and multiple kidney stones.
For vacuum suction effect, it revealed the following: stone-free rate in vacuum suction group (P = .007) and in non-vacuum suction group (P = .19).
Operative time in vacuum suction group (P = .89), non-vacuum suction group (P = .16).
Postoperative fever in vacuum suction group (P = .49), non-vacuum suction group (P = .85).
Conclusion: This pooled analysis indicated that MPCNL was a safe and effective method for treating renal stones compared with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
Besides, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role.
When it comes to multiple or staghorn stones, the longer operative time in MPCNL could not be ignored.
