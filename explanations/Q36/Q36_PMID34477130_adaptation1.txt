I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL), when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones versus the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy that uses a larger instrument to remove stones.
Researchers analyze data from published clinical trials.
Eligible trials are from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library.
The articles of these clinical trials included a list of other existing studies that are also reviewed.
The analysis includes 10 trials with 1612 patients.
The data gathered and analyzed from the 10 trials found revealed information on the following: stone-free rate, how long the procedures take, length of hospital stay, red blood cells decrease, fever after the procedure, and urine leakage.
Researchers also analyzed additional data on the effects of vacuum suction (vacuuming up stone fragments) and multiple kidney stones.
For vacuum suction effect, it reveals a difference in the stone-free rate in the vacuum suction group but not in the non-vacuum suction group.
There is no significant difference in how long the procedure took between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group.
There is no significant difference in having a fever after the procedure between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group.
In conclusion, this analysis suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones compared with the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy process.
Additionally, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role.
When it comes to multiple or staghorn (larger) stones, the longer procedure time in MPCNL could not be ignored.
