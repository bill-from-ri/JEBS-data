I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. Itâ€™s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Kidney stones are a major burden on the health care system.
The number of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, and yearly healthcare costs are at $3.8 billion.
It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems.
The most common symptoms include blood in the urine, pain in the back and sides, groin, or stomach area (abdomen).
There are many treatment methods available for managing kidney stones.
These options range from non-invasive (non-surgical) outpatient procedures that do not require hospital stays to invasive (surgical) procedures requiring staying in the hospital and an increased risk of complications.
Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) that require an incision into the skin.
ESWL is effective because it can crush stones inside the body into smaller parts, which are then released from the body when going to the bathroom.
Shockwaves are generated and focused on a point within the body.
The shockwaves go through the body with little damage to surrounding tissues.
When the stone changes, there is a big difference in the density of the stone which may produce a larger reach of energy due to a lot of shockwaves in a small area of the body.
This energy can overpower the strength of the stone, resulting in breaking the stone into smaller parts.
Repeating this process leads to the pulverizing of the stone into small fragments that the body can then pass through the body with no pain.
