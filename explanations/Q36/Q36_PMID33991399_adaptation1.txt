I have had a kidney stone in for almost three years. It’s killing me and none even noticed it till now, even on ultrasound, how will it be taken out?

Medical expulsive therapy uses medication to relax certain muscles in the body to release small kidney stones. The main goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase stone release along the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder called the ureter to avoid obstruction, reduce pain, and avoid the need for surgical and other procedures.
This review focuses on the findings from animal and human studies that investigate the ways drugs work in the ureter and how drugs may potentially help release stones from the body.
How the ureter tube, that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, is able to contract changes over time and makes interpreting results from studies on drugs difficult and, therefore, hard to find the best drugs for medical explusive therapy.
However, the current types of drugs used for patients with stones include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers, that can increase the size of the urinary tube to allow stones to pass, as well as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for pain. There are promising drugs under development for study.
