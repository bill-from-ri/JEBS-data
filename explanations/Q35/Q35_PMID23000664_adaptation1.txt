How often should i have a bone density test?

Current expert panel guidance for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) testing states that not enough data exist on the best period of time in between tests and that periods of over 2 years may be needed to better predict the risk of breaking bones.
In addition, the guidance mentions a study showing that measuring BMD after 8 years only helped a small amount to predict osteoporosis compared with initial BMD scan results.
Re-think the period of time between osteoporosis checks; for women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) with an initial normal bone mineral density (BMD) or slightly weaker than normal bones, 15 years between checks is likely enough.
