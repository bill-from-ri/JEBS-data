How often should i have a bone density test?

Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and the increase in the risk of bone breaks it causes has worried women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men and could become a huge problem.
The best way to diagnose osteoporosis is bone densitometry, a common test to measure bone density.
Large-scale checks may not be possible due to economic issues or availability of densitometry.
We aimed to make and test a scoring system to help doctors find which women are more likely to develop osteoporosis and should have more testing with bone densitometry.
We looked at records for 1522 women who have gone through menopause over 50 years old who had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a common test for bone density).
We compared risk scores to bone density tests.
We measured BMD at the hip and lower spine.
We excluded people who were previously diagnosed with osteoporosis or were taking drugs affecting bones.

We came up with a simple calculation based on age, weight, history of previous falls from a standing height or lower, early menopause, and use of a certain kind of steroid.
Testing of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) shows high accuracy for osteoporosis detection.
OPERA shows high accuracy for no detection.
The accuracy for results detecting osteoporosis ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding accuracy for results not detecting osteoporosis reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively.

We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective way to identify Italian women who have gone through menopause at higher risk of osteoporosis.
Use of OPERA could help the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.
