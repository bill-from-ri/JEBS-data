How often should i have a bone density test?

We rated the number and variation (or differences) across the country of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs - useful tests for measuring bone density) repeated in under 2 years (short-interval) in people on Medicare during a specific period.
Use of short-interval DXAs varied across the country and unlike other DXAs, use went down with Medicare payment cuts.
A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures found measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care "physicians and patients should question."
We rated the number and variation across the country of short-interval DXAs in people on Medicare during a specific period and estimated the testing cost and how much is changed based on payment.
We used only information from Medicare claims in 2006-2011 to find DXAs and short-term DXAs for females over age 66 on Medicare.
We found out how many DXAs and short-term DXAs were done, and how many Medicare dollars were spent on short-interval DXAs, across the country and by healthcare markets.
From 2008-2011, DXA use was steady (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women).
DXA use varied across healthcare markets.
Short-interval DXA use changed a lot based on payment; other DXAs did not.
In 2011, Medicare spent about $16 million USD on short-interval DXAs, which made up 10.1% of all DXAs.
We conclude that one out of 10 DXAs was done sooner than recommended, costing Medicare considerably.
DXA use varied across the country.
Short-interval DXA use changed based on payment, suggesting policy and payment changes may decrease this low-value care.
