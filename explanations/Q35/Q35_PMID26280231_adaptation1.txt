How often should i have a bone density test?

Bone breaks due to osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) happen in about 50% of white women and 20% of white men in their lifetime.
Bone breaks cause loss of physical function, high costs, and increased death.
An expert panel recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, or bone density scanning, to check all women 65 year and older, and younger women who are more likely to have bone breaks based on a popular measurement tool to measure fracture risk.
Although there are not guidelines for rechecking women who have initial normal bone mineral density, four years between checks looks safe.
The expert panel did not find enough proof to recommend checking for osteoporosis in men; other groups recommend checking all men 70 years and older.
In people with newly found osteoporosis, lab tests to find underlying causes include measuring blood levels of different substances.
The best treatment to prevent breaks includes preventing falls, stopping smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning.
Doctors should think about stopping a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning after five years in women without a history of spine breaks.
Other types of drugs for osteoporosis exist for certain groups of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition is not helped by one group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning.
The need to recheck bone mineral density in people taking drugs for osteoporosis is unknown.
