How often should i have a bone density test?

We aimed to make an Osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) Self-Assessment Tool for Taiwan (OSTAi) and compare this with existing 2013 guidelines for bone mineral density (BMD) testing among Taiwan women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period).
We tested women nationwide using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; a common text to measure bone density) between 2008 and 2011.
All women filled out a questionnaire, which included individual information and risk factors of bone breaks caused by osteoporosis.
We used this information to look at possible risk factors for osteoporosis.
We set up OSTAi to find those who needed BMD measurement.
We compared accuracy for disease detection and no detection between OSTAi and the 2013 guidelines.
We studied 12,175 Taiwan women who had gone through menopause.

There are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393).

OSTAi showed slightly lower accuracy for disease detection and higher accuracy for no detection than 2013 guidelines.
OSTAi is useful to find Taiwan women who have gone through menopause with osteoporosis.
Compared to current guidelines, OSTAi may be an easier and better tool to determine who should have DXA in Taiwan.
