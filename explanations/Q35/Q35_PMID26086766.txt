How often should i have a bone density test?

Background: To develop an OSTAi tool and compare this with the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommendations in 2013 (NOF 2013) for bone mineral density (BMD) testing among Taiwan postmenopausal women.
Methods: Taiwan Osteoporosis Association (TOA) conducted a nationwide BMD survey by a bus installed with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) between 2008 and 2011.
All of the participants completed questionnaire, which included demographics and risk factors of osteoporotic fracture in FRAX tool.
We used the database to analyze potential risk factors for osteoporosis and followed the model by Koh et al. to develop a risk index via multiple variable regression analysis and item reduction.
We used the index values to set up a simple algorithm (namely OSTAi) to identify those who need BMD measurement.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the sensitivity/specificity analysis of this model with that of recommendations by NOF 2013.
Results: A total of 12,175 Taiwan postmenopausal women enrolled in this survey.
The index value was derived by age and body weight of the participants according to weighted odds of each risk factor and the selected cutoff value was set at "-1".
There are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose index value is below "-1" and whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393).
The AUC for OSTAi and NOF 2013 were 0.739 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.728-0.749, P<0.001) and 0.618 (95% CI, 0.606-0.630, P<0.001), respectively.
The sensitivity and specificity of OSTAi, at the selected cutoff value of -1, and NOF 2013 to identify osteoporosis were 73.1%, 62.0% and 78.3%, 45.7%, respectively.
Conclusions: As OSTA for Asian populations, OSTAi is an useful tool to identify Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,
In comparison with NOF 2013, OSTAi may be an easier and better tool for referral to BMD measurement by DXA in this area.
