Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

Endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (ETIHL) (hair loss from hormonal therapy) linked with aromatase inhibitors (drugs used to treat breast cancer) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) is reported but remains unsolved in patients with breast cancer (BC). This is largely because the number of studies regarding this hair loss management is limited.
We checked the possible causes of this medical problem and its link to hormonal therapies used for BC survivors. We also made practical recommendations based on relevant medical studies to provide optimal management.
Based on medical papers, common causes of hair loss besdies hormonal therapies should be checked with a starting evaluation workup and then corrected if found.
Treatment with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (drugs for treating hair loss) applied on skin and Vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acid supplements may be the best treatment for ETIHL without causing serious side effects on BC recovery.
However, more in-depth studies are needed to confirm our results and identify the effects of this problem on BC patients.
