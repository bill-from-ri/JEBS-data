Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

We report 5 cases of common alopecia (hair loss or thinning) in female patients undergoing hormonal anticancer therapy to prevent reoccuring breast cancer after surgery.
Three patients showed alopecia common to males with receding hairlines in the front. Two patients showed alopecia common to females without receding hairlines.
The patient history showed that common alopecia of the patients developed after full recovery of complete hair loss of the scalp due to prior, severe chemotherapy (cancer treatment).
All of the secondary hormonal anticancer drugs used in patients are antiestrogenic agents (which influence levels of estrogen, a female sex hormone). These agents include aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor modulators.
Considering the effect of hormones on hair follicles in the front scalp, the estrogen-hormone imbalance caused by the drugs was thought to be the reason for visible alopecia in patients. 
In general, alopecia that develops during severe chemotherapy (cancer therapy) is known to physicians and patients. However, the identification of alopecia during hormonal anticancer therapy in breast cancer patients seems to be overlooked.
