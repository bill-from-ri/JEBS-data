Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

Previous studies showed that both anastrozole and letrozole (drugs to treat breast cancer) are well tolerated.
Letrozole reduces estrogen (a female sex hormone) more than anastrozole in the blood and breast tumor.
There are concerns that its greater strength may harm patients' quality of life (QOL).
One hundred eighty-one women who have finished their last period and with harmful estrogen-related breast cancers received either 12 weeks of letrozole followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole or the reverse.
One hundred and six received immediate, secondary aromatase inhibitors (Ais) (drugs used to treat breast cancer) after surgery. 75 received extended secondary therapy.
Hormonal-cancer-therapy-specific questionnaires were completed to measure QOL on each drug.
Descriptions of side effects were collected.
Each patient completed a patient preference form.
Twenty-one patients quit before the study's end. 10/179 (5.6%) quit while taking letrozole, and 4/173 (2.3%) quit while taking anastrozole.
Pateints treated with tamoxifen (an estrogen-influencing medication) had a higher hormonal symptom score at the start versus those with long-term therapy.
There was no change in hormonal therapy scores while patients were taking anastrozole or letrozole. There was also no significant differences between drugs.
Almost 80% of patients mentioned one or more side effects with either agent.
No difference in frequency, severity, or range of side effects were seen between drugs.
Of 160 patients, 49 (30.6%) preferred letrozole, 57 (35.6%) preferred anastrozole, and 54 (33.8%) had no preference.
In conclusion, both Ais are equally tolerated.
There were no differences in QOL scores between the two drugs.
