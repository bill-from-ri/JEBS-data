Does anastrozole causes hair loss & dry patches in your scalp?

For the study's background, aromatase inhibitors (Ais) are common hormone therapy (HT) for the secondary treatment of postmenopausal hormone-sensitive early breast cancer.
Treatment stoppage due to toxicitiy is an important issue that may help clinicians find effective clinical treatments to allow proper treatment duration.
We reviewed the main reasors for interruption of Ais at our center from 2006 to 2009.
For the study's methods, 236 patients treated with secondary Ais were analyzed.
Average age was 64 years (ranging from 35 to 89 years). Average treatment follow-up was 53 months (ranging from 6 to 60).
Prior secondary chemotherapy (cancer-specific drugs) was taxane for 47 patients and anthracycline for 43 patients.
118 patients received letrozole, 101 anastrozole, and 17 exemestane (breast cancer-treating drugs).
Twenty-four patients (10%) needed stoppage of the first AI assigned due to toxicity. 
Severe arthralgia (joint stiffness) was the main reason for stoppage in 13/24 patients.
No differences in the frequency of arthralgia were noted in patients who received taxanes or anthracyclines.
Headache, alopecia (hair loss or thinning), itching, skin reactions, allergic reactions with high-blood-pressure events, xerostomia (dry mouth), xerophthalmia (eye dryness), lack of sleep, and sleepiness were other reasons for stopping treatment.
With mathematical analysis, age (65 years) and HT were linked with the start of arthralgia.
Alternative HT (AI or tamoxifen - an estrogen-influencing drug) was offered to patients who wanted or needed to permanently stop the ongoing drug.
In conclusion, 10% of patients stopped the first AI assigned because of toxicity.
Average time course of all side effects leading to HT stoppage was 155 days and 135 days for arthralgia.
A switch to another HT with toxicity monitoring is recommended for avoiding premature and permanent stoppage of an effective treatment.
