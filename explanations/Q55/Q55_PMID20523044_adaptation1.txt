Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Phosphatidylserine (PS), a fatty substance, may have beneficial effects on cognitive (or thinking-related) functions.
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a unique formula of PS (PS-DHA or PS with omega-3 fatty acids) in non-demented elderly with memory complaints.
The study evaluated 157 participants. The participants were randomly assigned one of two treatment groups: PS-DHA or placebo (sham treatment). Treatments were given for 15 weeks.
Effectiveness measures were assessed before and after treatment.
Clinicians' Global Impression of Change (a point scale to determine if illness has improved) was assessed (measured) following 7 and 15 weeks of treatment.
131 participants completed the study. However, 9 were excluded as they did not follow the study rules.
At the end of the study, verbal immediate recall was significantly improved in the PS-DHA group compared to the placebo group.
Post-study analysis showed that a subset of participants with relatively good cognitive performance prior to treatment had significant treatment-associated improvements in cognitive function.
These favorable results were further supported by the proportion of participants who achieved a pre-defined level of improvement.
The results indicate that PS-DHA may improve cognitive performance in non-demented elderly with memory complaints.
Post-study analysis of subgroups suggests that participants with higher baseline cognitive status were most likely to respond to PS-DHA.
The results of this study should be followed up by additional studies to confirm the tentative conclusions made here.
