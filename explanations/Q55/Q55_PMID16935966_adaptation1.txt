Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Scientific evidence suggests that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or long-lasting tiredness, may be associated with persistent viral infection.
These infections may impair the body's ability to biosynthesize (create) fatty acids by inhibiting (blocking) the enzymatic reaction associated with essential fatty acids.
This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes (cell boundaries), including cell signaling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of signaling molecules.
These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis.
A potential treatment could be found in virgin cold-pressed primrose oil. The oil would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes (specific fatty substances).
The resulting acid and triterpenes would be further converted into beneficial compounds.
Furthermore, the resulting compounds are virucidal or can destroy inactive viruses.
