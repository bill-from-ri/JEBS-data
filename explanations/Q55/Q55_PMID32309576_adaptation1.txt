Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Membrane Lipid Replacement is a treatment that uses oral (by mouth) supplements to safely replace damaged membrane lipids (fatty substances on cell boundaries).  Lipids are organic compounds such as fats, waxes, oils, and hormones. These damaged lipids accumulate during aging and various diseases.
The majority of clinical conditions and aging are characterized by membrane phospholipid oxidative damage. This damage results in loss of membrane and cellular function.
Clinical trials have shown the benefits of Membrane Lipid Replacement supplements in replenishing damaged membrane lipids and restoring mitochondrial function. These supplements help reduce fatigue in aged subjects and patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses.
Recent observations have indicated that Membrane Lipid Replacement can be a useful natural supplement strategy in a variety of conditions. Some of these conditions include chronic fatigue (long-lasting tiredness), chronic infections, and cancers.
Membrane Lipid Replacement provides general membrane nutritional support during aging and illness. This improves membrane function and overall health without risk of adverse effects.
