Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioural disorder of childhood, affecting 3-5% of school-age children.
The present study investigated whether the supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (PS), a naturally occurring phospholipid, improves ADHD symptoms in children.
Methods: Thirty six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to ADHD, received placebo (n = 17) or 200 mg day(-1) PS (n = 19) for 2 months in a randomised, double-blind manner.
Main outcome measures included: (i) ADHD symptoms based on DSM-IV-TR; (ii) short-term auditory memory and working memory using the Digit Span Test of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and (iii) mental performance to visual stimuli (GO/NO GO task).
Results: PS supplementation resulted in significant improvements in: (i) ADHD (P < 0.01), AD (P < 0.01) and HD (P < 0.01); (ii) short-term auditory memory (P < 0.05); and (iii) inattention (differentiation and reverse differentiation, P < 0.05) and inattention and impulsivity (P < 0.05).
No significant differences were observed in other measurements and in the placebo group.
PS was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects.
Conclusions: PS significantly improved ADHD symptoms and short-term auditory memory in children.
PS supplementation might be a safe and natural nutritional strategy for improving mental performance in young children suffering from ADHD.
