Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioral disorder of childhood. It affects 3-5% of school-age children.
This study investigated if supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (PS), a naturally occurring phospholipid or the fatty part of a cell's boundaries, improves ADHD symptoms in children.
Thirty six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to ADHD, were recruited. 17 kids received placebos (sham treatment) for 2 months, and 19 kids received 200 mg/day PS for 2 months.
Several measurements were taken to determine effectiveness.
PS supplementation resulted in significant improvements in: ADHD, AD, and HD. There was also improvement in short-term auditory memory, inattention, and impulsivity.
No significant differences were observed in other measurements and in the placebo group.
PS was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects.
PS significantly improved ADHD symptoms and short-term auditory memory in children.
PS supplementation might be a safe and natural nutritional strategy for improving mental performance in young children suffering from ADHD.
