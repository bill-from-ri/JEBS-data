Does phosphatidylserine support memory in people with me/cfs?

Sixty-three adults diagnosed with postviral fatigue (tiredness) syndrome were enrolled in a study of essential fatty acid therapy.
The patients had been ill for from one to three years after an apparently viral infection. They all suffered from severe fatigue, muscle pain, and a variety of psychiatric symptoms.
The participants were given one of two treatments: a formulated mixture or a placebo (sham treatment). The mixture contained linoleic, gamma-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (fatty molecules). The treatments were administered as 8 x 500 mg capsules per day over a 3-month period.
Patients were evaluated before treatment, after one month, and after three months.
Doctors assessed overall condition, fatigue, muscle pain, dizziness, poor concentration, and depression.
Essential fatty acid composition of their red cell membrane phospholipids (building blocks for the cell's wall) was analyzed at the first and last visits.
At 1 month, 74% of patients on active treatment and 23% of those on placebo assessed (measured) themselves as improved over the baseline. Improvement being much greater in the active treatment group.
At 3 months the corresponding figures were 85% and 17%. This is because the placebo group had reverted towards the baseline state while those in the active group showed continued improvement.
The essential fatty acid levels were abnormal at the baseline and corrected by active treatment.
There were no adverse (side) events.
The authors concluded essential fatty acids provide a rational, safe and effective treatment for patients with the post-viral fatigue syndrome.
