I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

This is a review of the drugs called antihistamines because they help with allergies caused by the body chemical histamine.
These drugs are used widely, but little is known about their interactions with human body. 



The max amount of antihistamines gets into the blood 2 to 3 hours after taking a pill or syrup.
The amounts of the drug that made it into the blood were about a third of the taken pill for chlorpheniramine, about half for diphenhydramine, and about a quarter for promethazine.
Most of these drugs are processed in the body by the liver. 
These drugs are usually removed from the body at a rate of  5 to 12 milliliters per minute for each kilogram of body weight. Half of the total amount of the drug is taken out of the body from about 3 hours to about 20 days. For cinnarizine it's about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole about 7 to 20 days, when taken for a long time; and for flunarizine about 18 to 20 days.
These drugs tend to go from the blood into the body tissues, meaning that a higher dose of a drug is needed to keep its levels in the blood. 
In children, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine go to half of the amount in the body faster than in adults.
In patients with liver disease due to alcohol, time to get half of the diphenhydramine  out lengthens from 9 to 15 hours.  In patients with kidney disease, time to get out chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged.
Almost nothing is known about these drugs in the bodies of newborns, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. 
Because half of the drug stays in the body longer for the older antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, they can be given to adults once daily.
