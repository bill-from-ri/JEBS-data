Several drugs can cause heart problems. It is important to monitor and evaluate risks of traditional drugs.
We study if taking hydroxyzine, a drug that relieves anxiety and also itch caused by allergies, is associated with fast, chaotic heartbeats.
We reviewed data from a drug safety database and the basic studies of hydroxyzine interactions with human cells. 
The drug safety data had 59 reports between December 1955 and August 2016 that linked fast chaotic heartbeats to hydroxyzine use.
Some people took too much of the drug (overdose). All other cases had medical problems or were taking other drugs along with hydroxyzine.
People who have heart problems and take drugs that can cause irregular heartbeat are at the greatest risk of complications due to hydroxyzine.
Studies show hydroxyzine can effect some heart functions.
Hydroxyzine should be listed as drug with "conditional risk of torsade de pointes". Hydroxyzine use in patients who are at risk for heart problems  should be limited.
