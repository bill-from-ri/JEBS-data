We studied relations between antihistamines (drugs for treating allergies)  and Torsade de Pointes (very fast heart rhythm) as reported to the FDA.
We found 406 reports on Torsade de Pointes and antihistamines. 
We used four different statistical methods to study the cases. 
Antihistamines that had more than three reports of torsade de pointes were included in the analysis. 
We found 12 drugs associated with torsade de pointes. Six of the drugs were not known before to cause torsade de pointes. 
Getting antihistamines with other drugs that cause heart complications was lower than for the known antihistamines.
The new antihistamines were associated with heart complications stronger than the known ones. 
The new antihistamines were associated with torsade de pointes stronger.
