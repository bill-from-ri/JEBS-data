I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

This study added hormone prednisone to antihistamines, the drugs that are usually used to treat hives (itchy skin rash). 


Adults with the rash that started no more than 24 hours ago participated in the study. 
Patients with wheezing, raspy breathing, swelling or those who took antihistamines or hormones within 5 days before coming to the emergency room were not included in the study. 
Diabetics and people with ulcers (open sores in the stomach) were not included too. 
All patients were asked to give their itch an "itch score" on a scale.
Patients then got a shot of an antihistamine diphenhydramine and were sent home. They  took an antihistamine hydroxyzine  every 4 to 8 hours for their itch. Patients also took another pill every 12 hours for 4 days. For some that pill was the hormone prednisone, and for some it was a placebo (did not contain any drug).
Patients came back to evaluate their each score 2 days later. 5 days later the score was evaluated by phone.
Out of f43 patients, 24 got prednisone and 19 placebo.
All had similar each scores at the beginning. After 2 and 5 days, those who had prednisone had lower itch scores and less rash. 
Patients' age, sex, and substances that caused allergies did not effect the itch score.
No patients had adverse reactions.
Adding prednisone improves antihistamine treatment of hives.
When prednisone was added, the skin cleared faster and more completely. There were no side effects.
