I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

First-generation antihistamines, drugs that help with allergies caused by histamine, a chemical profited by our bodies, often cause sleepiness and disturb brain functions in other ways. These drugs include diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine and chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine). 
Second-generation antihistamines, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, are better.
These drugs do not disturb brain functions when taken alone, and do not strengthen the disturbances caused by alcohol or other chemicals. 
Not often, the new antihistamines may cause heart rhythm disturbances; if a person takes too much of the drug or has other specific conditions.
Taking any antihistamines includes some risks. 

When taking antihistamines, people should consider the benefits and the risks carefully.
