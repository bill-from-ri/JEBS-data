I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

First-generation antihistamines (allergy drugs that cause drowsiness) are more powerful and cheaper than the second-generation antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness. 
Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that is used to relieve itching caused by allergies. We studied if taking hydroxyzine at bedtime reduces the side effects known to be caused by taking this drug divided in small doses. 
15 healthy adults took hydroxyzine every night at bedtime or another antihistamine  terfenadine or a pill that contained no drugs two times a day. 

Hydroxyzine caused drowsiness, dry mouth and moodiness more than terfenadine or placebo, but less than taking  hydroxyzine twice a day. 
Symptoms caused by terfenadine and placebo were about the same.
Both hydroxyzine and terfenadine lessened allergic reactions.
Hydroxyzine lessened allergic reactions in all people, but terfenadine failed to lessen the reaction in four of the 15 people. 
Taking hydroxyzine at bedtime somewhat lessened the symptoms and relieved skin itching the next morning. The side effects lasted not as long as with taking the drug twice daily.
The side effects and sluggish movements caused by the first-generation antihistamines can be lessened by changing when the drug is taken.
