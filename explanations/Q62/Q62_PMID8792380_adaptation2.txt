I have a hydroxyz pill with h and 502 on one side and white on reverse. Can i take that pill with a benedryl?

First generation antihistamines, drugs that stop allergies due to the body chemical histamine, may cause drowsiness. They are often given to children, but it is not known how they effect the children's brains
We believe that first generation antihistamines diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine may disturb  children's brain function.
We evaluated how these drugs effect body cells in children.
Fifteen children with seasonal allergy (hay fever) had tests before and after they took diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs.)
Their brain functions were evaluated by measuring the delays in response to events. 
They were also asked to evaluate how sleepy they felt. 

Diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine significantly increased the time it took to respond to the events. 
Hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine also increased sleepiness. 
Both antihistamines also reduced the allergies.
In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine help against allergies, but interfere with brain functions. These drugs cause longer response times, increase sleepiness and disturb mental processes.
