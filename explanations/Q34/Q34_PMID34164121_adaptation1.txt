Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Keeping a Mediterranean lifestyle may be a useful primary and secondary prevention plan for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
This study aims to explore adherence (commitment) to a Mediterranean lifestyle and its association with blood pressure, cholesterol, and other heart related measures, as well as its impact on kidney function. This study includes 99 people aged 73.2 years (plus or minus 10.5 years) with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, a process that uses a machine to filter blood.
Adherence is assessed (measured) using the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index, that includes questions on food consumption, dietary habits, physical activity, rest, and social interactions.
Tests on total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, blood sugar levels in the last 2-3 months and at any random time, and kidney function are collected from medical records and blood pressure measured at the start of the study.
Overall, adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is moderate to low with an average MEDLIFE index score of 11⋅33 ± 3⋅31.
Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is associated with employment.
Mediterranean dietary habits are associated with certain heart-related measures, such as how limiting sugar in beverages is associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (bottom number of blood pressure readings), eating in moderation with favorable blood sugar levels tested at random, having more than two snack foods per week with blood sugar tests, and LDL-cholesterol.
Interestingly, eating with others is associated with a lower frequency of depression.
In conclusion, Mediterranean dietary habits are positively linked with heart-related measures and care of other health problems in this group of people with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease.
