Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

About 10% of adults in Germany have chronic kidney disease, which is when the kidneys are damaged and can't filter waste and extra fluid from the blood.
The percentage of chronic kidney disease among patients being cared for by primary care doctors (family doctors) is about 30% and is over 50% in nursing homes.
A guideline has been developed for the care of chronic kidney disease in primary (family) care offices.
This guideline is based on existing, available data in articles published during 2013 - 2017 and also on additional searches of data on specific questions.
It is created by the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians and agreed with by the German Societies of Nephrology and Internal Medicine and patient representation.
At the first diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, the patient's blood pressure, as well as a urine sample that may indicate a kidney complication from high proteins, should be measured. The urine should also be checked for the presence of blood.
How often the patient should be monitored is based on the individual and depends on the stage of disease, the patient's overall health, and personal preferences.
A doctor who specializes in kidney disease should be consulted based on tests that check how well the kidneys are working, if there is blood in the urine, if the patient's blood pressure requires 3 or more drugs, and if the kidney disease is quickly getting worse.
The requirements and test levels to refer a patient under the age of 50 years for specialty care should be kept low. People over 70 should be referred only if necessary due to other illnesses and individual health goals.
The main parts of treating chronic kidney disease are the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes and changing lifestyle.
A new assessment from the family doctor is a sign of kidney disease due to too much of a protein called albumin in the urine.
