Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle may be a useful primary and secondary prevention strategy for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
This cross-sectional study aimed to explore adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle and its association with cardiometabolic markers and kidney function in 99 people aged 73⋅2 ± 10⋅5 years with non-dialysis dependant CKD (stages 3-5) at a single Australian centre.
Adherence was assessed using an a priori index, the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index.
Cardiometabolic markers (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c and random blood glucose) and kidney function (estimated GFR) were sourced from medical records and blood pressure measured upon recruitment.
Overall, adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle was moderate to low with an average MEDLIFE index score of 11⋅33 ± 3⋅31.
Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle was associated with employment (r 0⋅30, P = 0⋅004).
Mediterranean dietary habits were associated with cardiometabolic markers, such as limiting sugar in beverages was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (r 0⋅32, P = 0⋅002), eating in moderation with favourable random blood glucose (r 0⋅21, P = 0⋅043), having more than two snack foods per week with HbA1c (r 0⋅29, P = 0⋅037) and LDL-cholesterol (r 0⋅41, P = 0⋅002).
Interestingly, eating in company was associated with a lower frequency of depression (χ 2 5⋅975, P = 0⋅015).
To conclude, Mediterranean dietary habits were favourably associated with cardiometabolic markers and management of some comorbidities in this group of people with non-dialysis dependent CKD.
