Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Introduction: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) represents a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Vitamin D system is altered since early CKD, and vitamin D deficiency is an established trigger of SHPT.
Although untreated SHPT may degenerate into tertiary hyperparathyroidism with detrimental consequences in advanced CKD, best treatments for counteracting SHPT from stage 3 CKD are still debated.
Enthusiasm on prescription of vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA) in non-dialysis renal patients, has been mitigated by the risk of low bone turnover and positive calcium-phosphate balance.
Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-line therapy to treat SHPT with low 25(OH)D insufficiency.
However, no high-grade evidence supports the best choice between ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, and calcifediol (in its immediate or extended-release formulation).
Areas covered: The review discusses available data on safety and efficacy of nutritional vitamin D, VDRA and nutritional therapy in replenishing 25(OH)D deficiency and counteracting SHPT in non-dialysis CKD patients.
Expert opinion: Best treatment for low 25(OH)D and SHPT remains unknown, due to incomplete understanding of the best homeostatic, as mutable, adaptation of mineral metabolism to CKD progression.
Nutritional vitamin D and nutritional therapy appear safest interventions, whenever contextualized with single-patient characteristics.
VDRA should be restricted to uncontrolled SHPT by first-line therapy.
