Stage 3 kidney disease. Is there a shot you can take that will keep you off dialysis?

Background: Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (PEG-EPO) is indicated for the treatment of anaemia due to chronic kidney disease.
Its long half-life allows it to be administered once per month in maintenance therapy.
Objective: To evaluate the use, effectiveness and cost of PEG-EPO in a group of pre-dialysis chronic renal failure patients.
Method: Retrospective observational study in pre-dialysis patients who began treatment with PEG-EPO between May 2008 and February 2009.
The following data were gathered: age, sex, haemoglobin levels (Hb) and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose and frequency.
The follow-up period was 12 months.
Results: We included 198 patients.
Mean Hb upon starting PEG-EPO in patients who had received no prior treatment was 10.8g/l, and 11.6g/l at 90 days (P<.0001).
In patients previously treated with ESA, mean Hb before starting PEG-EPO treatment was 11.2g/l, and 11.4g/l at 12 months (P=.846).
Hb values were higher than 12g/l (P<.0001) after 12 months of treatment in 25% of patients; of these, 45% had values above 13g/l.
We observed doses 39% lower than those indicated on the drug leaflet, resulting in a reduction in the originally expected theoretical costs.
Conclusions: The doses of PEG-EPO administered to patients with a prior history of ESA treatment were lower than those indicated by the drug leaflet, and Hb remained stable after 12 months of treatment.
A large portion of the patients had levels above the 13g/l threshold.
