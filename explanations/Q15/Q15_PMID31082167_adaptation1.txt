How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Potassium is mainly an ion (an atom or molecule that carries an electrical charge) within a body of water within cells.
A protein pump in cells called the sodium-potassium pump regulates and moves sodium and potassium in and out of cells.
In the kidneys, the filtering and moving of potassium takes place at the glomerulus, a cluster of tiny blood cells.
Potassium is reabsorbed at the proximal convoluted tubule (in a filtering unit called the nephron that is part of the kidneys) and the thick ascending loop of Henle (a part of the nephron in the kidneys).
Potassium is released at the distal convoluted tubule (a portion of the kidney nephron that functions in both absorption and secretion or release).
A hormone called aldosterone increases the release of potassium.
Potassium is also released through protein channels that allow potassium molecules to pass through the cells and cell boundaries.
Potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beats).
Hypokalemia occurs when there are low potassium levels in the blood and results in weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching.
