How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Kidneys play an important role in monitoring acid-base and electrolyte balance, which is a requirement for many metabolic processes and organ functions in the human body.
Long-lasting kidney diseases threaten the regulatory functions, leading to changes in electrolyte and acid-base balance that can be life-threatening.
We review the kidney's regulation of electrolyte and acid-base balance and disorders involving their imbalances.
Common, long-lasting kidney disorders are also discussed.
The most recent and relevant treatments on the biology and treatment of these conditions have been included.
