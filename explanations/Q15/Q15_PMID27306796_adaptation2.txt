How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Kidney-related potassium (K) secretion helps maintain K balance.
Kidney-related K removal commonly focuses on specific parts of sub-kidney units. In these units, K is pulled in by outer-facing protein, which transports K and sodium across a boundary, and is secreted into the inner tube by ROMK (Kir1.1), a K-specific transport protein, and calcium-activated K-specific transport channel.
Recently, gene-related studies and animal models have shown that inwardly correcting potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in a specific region of sub-kidney units may monitor potassium secretion in the hormone-sensitive, outward sub-kidney unit by targeting the sodium-chloride cotransporter.
This review summarizes recent improvements regarding the role of Kir4.1 channel in regulating the sodium-chloride cotransporter and potassium secretion.
Kir4.1 is active in the outer-facing boundary of a specific region of the sub-kidney units and helps transport potassium outward and create a negative boundary charge.
Kir4.1 is also the target of a high-energy transporting protein. This transporting protein activates Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units.
The gene-related deletion or silencing of Kir4.1 changes the charge of the boundary of a specific region of sub-kidney units, blocks a high-energy transporting protein, and prevents sodium-chloride channel activity.
Also, reducing Kir4.1 activity increases boundary-lining sodium channel activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units and K removal via urine.
Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units have low blood magnesium and low blood potassium.
Recent progress in exploring the monitoring and use of Kir4.1 in a specific region of sub-kidney units shows that Kir4.1 helps begin the monitoring of kidney-related K removal by targeting sodium-chloride channels. Kir4.1 may also be a K sensor in the kidney.
