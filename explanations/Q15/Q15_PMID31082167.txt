How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

Potassium is mainly an intracellular ion.
The sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump has the primary responsibility for regulating the homeostasis between sodium and potassium, which pumps out sodium in exchange for potassium, which moves into the cells.
In the kidneys, the filtration of potassium takes place at the glomerulus.
The reabsorption of potassium takes place at the proximal convoluted tubule and thick ascending loop of Henle.
Potassium secretion occurs at the distal convoluted tubule.
Aldosterone increases potassium secretion.
Potassium channels and potassium-chloride cotransporters at the apical membrane also secrete potassium.
Potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias.
Hypokalemia occurs when serum potassium levels under 3.6 mmol/Lâ€”weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching present in hypokalemia.
