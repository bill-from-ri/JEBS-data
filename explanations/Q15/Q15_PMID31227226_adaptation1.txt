How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

The total-body content of potassium (K+) and distribution of K+ across the cell membranes (the thick layer that surrounds cells) is very important for normal functioning of the body's cells.
Total-body K+ content (a method for measuring body composition and mass of cells) is determined by changes in the release of K+ by the kidneys in response to how much K+ is taken in.
Insulin (a hormone that allows the cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar from the blood) and Î²-adrenergic tone (a group of organs and nerves where hormones are able to signal to other cells) also help keep potassium (K+) distribution at normal levels.
Despite these different systems, disorders of changing K+ levels are common.
Understanding the pathophysiology (physical changes that come with a particular syndrome or disease) and regulating processes that determine how the body distributes and balances K+ is key to developing treatments to restore K+ homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid).
Researchers review the normal regulating process of total-body potassium (K+) before highlighting common disorders in K+ homeostasis and their treatment.
This review of K+ homeostasis is a resource for health care providers and a tool for educators teaching students to understand key factors involved in K+ balance.
