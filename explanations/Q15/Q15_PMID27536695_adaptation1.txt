How does human body maintain hypokalemia shock homeostasis?

There is a large amount of potassium (a mineral the body needs to function properly) in the fluid within cells.
Regulating or monitoring how potassium passes in and out of cells is very important, so sudden or major changes of potassium levels in the blood may be life-threatening.
The body has a system with 'internal' and 'external' controls that prevents changes of blood levels when potassium is increasing or decreasing.
The 'internal' control monitors the change in potassium as it moves in and out of cells to help maintain a stable level of potassium.
The 'external' control is responsible for excreting (releasing) the potassium, and the kidney is the main part of this process.
The kidney releases nearly 90% of the daily intake of potassium.
In some parts within the kidney, potassium is reabsorbed at a fixed or constant amount, but other portions of the kidneys have the ability to adjust the release of potassium based on what is needed to maintain a potassium balance.
This review analyzes the following: (1) the cell processes that reabsorb and release potassium along the nephron (a filter located in the kidneys); (2) the pathophysiology (functional changes in the body that come with a particular syndrome or disease) from renal (kidney-related) problems; and (3) the effect of ingested potassium from food on blood pressure and renal electrolytes.
Key messages in this review are that maintaining potassium levels in the blood in a tight range is very important for life. Therefore, multiple factors are connected with potassium homeostasis (the correct amount of potassium for the body to function), including kidney function.
Recent studies with animals have suggested that potassium levels affect renal (kidney-related) salt absorption and this effect may be the cause of decreased blood pressure in hypertensive (high-blood pressure) patients using potassium supplements.
