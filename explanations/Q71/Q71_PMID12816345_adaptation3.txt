What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism is a sporadic autosomal dominant condition that occurs in approximately 1:20,000 births.
The major health impact of Achondroplasia is reduced growth, shortening of the long bones and abnormalitiesin the bones of the head and face.
As of today there is no drug treatment for Achondroplasia.
Some improvement in the patients well being and daily function can be achieved by a surgical limb lengthening procedure.
Growth hormone treatment seems to have only modest short term success and to lack long term benefits.
Achondroplasia results from a mutation in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3).
In 97% of the patients, the mutation leads to overactivation of the protein coded for by the FGFR3 gene.
This protein is found in cells in the growth area of developing long bones and plays a crucial role in bone growth.
Disruption of the FGFR-3 gene in mice leads to a remarkable increase in the length of the vertebral column and long bones.
This suggests that overaction of FGFR3 impairs cell function in the growth regions of the bone and causes Achondroplasia.
Normal bone growth may therefore be achieved by reducing FGFR3 activity in the appropriate cells within the growth region of the bones.
It is highly conceivable that drug development strategies aimed either towards blocking overaction of the FGFR3 and related activities may prove successful in the treatment of Achondroplasia.
This review focuses on the possible approaches for developing a drug for Achondroplasia and related bone diseases.
