What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

The purpose of this review is to summarize current research and care for people with achondoplasia (a form of dwarfism).
Achondroplasia is the most common nonlethal bone growth impairment and its characteristics can be seen at birth.
A lot of information is available about how achondroplasia progresses over time.
Achondroplasia is diagnosed by a medical exam and X-rays.
Achondroplasia is characterised by features such as short limbs and a relatively large head.
Children commonly have ear infections, delayed walking, and eventually develop bowed legs and a curve in the back.
People with achondroplasia are generally of normal intelligence.
The genetic cause of achondroplasia was discovered in 1994.
Since then, research efforts aim to understand the mechanisms that lead to achondroplasia as well as to develop and improve treatments.
Diagnosis for achondroplasia allows families and doctors to plan future care for affected children.
Coordinating care between professionals from different disciplines helps each child with achodroplasia get the best treatment.
