What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

This review focuses on the muscle and bone-related features of achondroplasia, which is the most common bone growth impairment and the most frequent cause of short-limbed dwarfism.
The gene that causes achondroplasia affects many members of a family but in the majority of cases is due to a new mutation.
The diseases is related to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) gene and results in a continuously active receptor.
Experiments show that FGFR3 prevents bone growth by preventing cartilage cells in the bone growth region from growing and maturing.
The mutation responsible for achondroplasia prevents growth of long bones.
The diagnosis of achondroplasia is based on physical and X-ray features including short stature, large head with a prominent forehead, underdevelopment of the middle part of the face and shortening of the limbs.
The most common bone-related complications of achondroplasia are  shortening of the spine and deformities of the lower limbs.
Current treatment and future therapies are discussed.
