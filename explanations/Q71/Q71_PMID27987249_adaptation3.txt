What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) cause achondroplasia (Ach), the most common form of dwarfism in humans and related chondrodysplasia syndromes that include hypochondroplasia (Hch), severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN), and thanatophoric dysplasia (TD). The mutations are passed on nonsex chromosomes and causes the child that inherits the mutation from an affected parent to have a 50% chance to be affected.
FGFR3 is expressed in cartilage cells and mature bone-forming cells where it functions to regulate bone growth.
Analysis of the mutations in FGFR3 revealed increased signaling through a combination of mechanisms that include stabilization of the receptor, enhanced binding of two receptors to each other, and enhanced enzyme activity of the receptor.
Paradoxically, increased FGFR3 signaling profoundly suppresses cell multiplication and maturation of growth plate cartilage cells resulting in decreased growth region size, reduced volume of the ends of long bones, and resulting decreased bone elongation.
In this review, authors discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate growth region cartilage cells, development of Achondroplasia (Ach), and therapeutic approaches that are being evaluated to improve bone growth in people with Ach and related conditions.
