What happens in the body to cause achondroplasia?

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) play significant roles in vertebrate organ development.
FGFR3 prevents cartilage formation and some mutations with continuously active FGFR3 result in achondroplasia, a common dwarfism in humans, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive.
In this study, the authors found that removing BMP type I receptor a (Bmpr1a) from cartilage cells rescued the bone overgrowth observed in Fgfr3 deficient mice by reducing differentiation of cartilage cells.
Consistently, using a cartilage cell differentiation assay system, the authors demonstrated that FGFR3 inhibited BMPR1a-mediated maturation of cartilage cells.
Furthermore, they showed that FGFR3 hyper-activation resulted in impaired BMP signaling in cartilage cells of mouse growth plates.
The authors also found that FGFR3 inhibited BMP-2- or constitutively activated BMPR1-induced phosphate group addition of Smads through a mechanism independent of its enzyme activity.
They found that FGFR3 facilitates BMPR1a to through a common protein breakdown pathway called the ubiquitination pathway. Smurf1 played a role in this protein breakdown pathway.
They demonstrated that decreasing of BMP signaling by BMPR1 inhibitor dorsomorphin led to the retardation of cartilage cell maturation, which mimics the effect of FGF-2 on cartilage cells. BMP-2 treatment partially rescued the retarded growth of cultured bone rudiments from thanatophoric dysplasia type II mice.
Their findings reveal that FGFR3 promotes the degradation of BMPR1a, and this plays an important role in the development of FGFR3-related bone growth impairment.
