Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

The new Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease) is a serious threat to health and financial stability because of a lack of vaccines and treatments.
Low-grade inflammation (how the body responds to infection) is a common factor in cases that become more serious, and low levels of vitamins and minerals may contribute to this inflammation.
The aim of this paper is to explore the usefulness of starting certain vitamins and minerals early, especially zinc, selenium (a mineral found in water and foods), and vitamin D, to keep Covid-19 infections from becoming more serious.
Researchers did an online search for scientific articles published from 2010 to 2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, in addition to corona and similar virus infections.
There are a few studies that show direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and Covid-19.
Getting enough zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is important for the body to resist other viral infections, as well as for immune function and to reduce inflammation, which is the body's response to infections.
Therefore, it is suggested that changing nutrition to get enough of these vitamins and minerals might provide protection against the coronavirus and keep Covid-19 infection from becoming serious.
Researchers of this paper recommend giving supplements to high-risk areas and/or soon after suspected infection with coronavirus.
People in high-risk groups should have a high priority to receive nutrition supplements and therapies, which should be started before specific and supportive medical measures.
