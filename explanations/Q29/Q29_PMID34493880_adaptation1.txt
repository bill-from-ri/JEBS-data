Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

The World Health Organization called the new coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - a viral lung infection) a pandemic in early 2020 after the disease spread to over 180 countries.
This paper aims to summarize the evidence for the relationships between nutrition and boosting the immune system in the fight against Covid-19 caused by the coronavirus.
This review discusses the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements (an additional amount of vitamins or minerals often in the form of a pill) on the body's defense system against coronavirus.
The results show that there is a strong connection between taking ingredients like vitamin C-E and minerals such as zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection.
These can be received from either foods that have a lot of healthy nutrients or from vitamin supplements.
Also, these tiny molecules might have roles to play in boosting the immune response as well as the healing process and recovery time.
Researchers of this study recommend that eating healthy foods with a lot of vitamins C-E with zinc and other vitamins from plants called flavonoids found in many fruits and vegetables could boost the immune system and help protect the body from serious infections.
