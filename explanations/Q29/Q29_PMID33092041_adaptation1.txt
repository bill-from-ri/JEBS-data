Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Virus infections are a leading cause of illness and death across the world, and the importance of practices such as handwashing and vaccination in reducing the spread of viruses is well known.
It is also well known that proper nutrition can help support a healthy immune system, which reduces the impact of infections.
Several vitamins and minerals in small amounts play an important role in supporting the cells of the immune system, which can help the body resist infections.
Other nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, help keep the function of the immune system running well.
The aim of this paper is to discuss how adding vitamins and minerals (also called micronutrients) to the body might support immunity, especially immunity against viruses that impact the lungs.
A review of existing studies shows the important role of vitamins A, C, and D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in influencing the immune response.
Using vitamin, omega-3 fatty acid, and zinc supplements appears to be a safe and low-cost way to support immune system function. These supplements also have the possibility of reducing the risk and effects of infections, including viruses that cause lung infection.
Supplements should be an addition to healthy diets and should be taken at the safe amounts recommended by experts.
Developing a good nutrition plan, with micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids supplements, might be a cost-effective way to help reduce the effects of infectious diseases around the world, including Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease).
