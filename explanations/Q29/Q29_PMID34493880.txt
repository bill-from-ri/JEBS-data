Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2, as a global pandemic in early 2020 after the disease spread to more than 180 countries leading to tens of thousands of cases and many deaths within a couple of months.
Consequently, this paper aims to summarize the evidence for the relationships between nutrition and the boosting of the immune system in the fight against the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
This review, in particular, assesses the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements on the body's defence mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2.
The results revealed that there is a strong relationship between the ingestion of biological ingredients like vitamins C-E, and minerals such as zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection.
These can be received from either nutrition rich food sources or from vitamin supplements.
Furthermore, these macromolecules might have roles to play in boosting the immune response, in the healing process and the recovery time.
Hence, we recommend that eating healthy foods rich in vitamins C-E with zinc and flavonoids could boost the immune system and consequently protect the body from serious infections.
