Is there any nutrition which can increase body immunity against covid 19?

Dietary strategies aimed at preventing COVID-19 and dangerous pneumonia are continually being considered.
Unfortunately, as in the case of drugs, studies in humans have not confirmed any specific food components to be effective in the case of COVID-19.
We know that the immune system is the key to reducing the severity of COVID-19, and perhaps by modulating it in the right way we can save human lives with preventive measures.
Numerous clinical studies have shown that nutraceuticals can beneficially stimulate the immune response in patients with various diseases, such as cancer or AIDS, and in healthy people at risk of viral infections.
Natural compounds are commonly recognized as valuable agents in the fight against viruses due to their structural diversity and safety.
Many products consumed by people and used in traditional medicine have been shown to contain substances with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, e.g., vitamin C in the fruit or juice of raspberries or elderberries, hesperidin in St. Johnâ€™s wort, kaempferol and methylglyoxal in honey, allicin in garlic and onion, gingerols in ginger, curcumin in turmeric, and piperine in black pepper.
However, there is no strong scientific evidence, nor are there any systematic literature reviews with meta-analyses indicating that herbs, spices, health-promoting food ingredients, or dietary supplements prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, mitigate COVID-19 symptoms, or can even be used to treat infections, including severe COVID pneumonia, acute lung failure, a cytokine storm, clotting disorders, or multiple organ failure.
