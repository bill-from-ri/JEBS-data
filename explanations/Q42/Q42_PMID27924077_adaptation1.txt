What are the types of histone proteins?

Acylations are parts of molecules that help groups of atoms called acyl groups connect to compounds in the body. Eight acylations are recently identified on histones, which are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome (DNA) and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. These 8 types are called propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and Î²-hydroxybutyrylation.
New evidence suggests that these histone changes affect how information from genes are used to build proteins or other molecules. These histones are also built different and have different functions from other common histones.
In this review, researchers discuss how some histones are regulated in the body and how some acylation proteins bring about the effects of other acylations and their functions.
Researchers develop a model to explain their understanding of how different histone acylations is regulated by metabolism (digestion) of other enzymes, which then adjust the regulation of genes.
