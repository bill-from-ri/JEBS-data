What are the types of histone proteins?

Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Histones that are released from injured or dying cells and remain outside of cells can lead to damaged molecules.
In fact, there are high levels of histones in humans during hyperinflammatory states, when the immune system goes into overdrive, such as acute respiratory or breathing-related distress or sepsis, which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues.
Understanding this process of changes in molecules because of histones is just starting.
However, making histones ineffective with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins), histones that attach to or break down proteins, and certain carbohydrate (sugar-containing) molecules that regulate functions of blood vessel walls have shown promising treatment effects in computer models of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.
Various cell types that are dying or are activated in the neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) are likely involved in too many histones being released which can worsen tissue injury and may result in multiple organ failure.
An uncontrolled inflammation response is considered as the major event; however, blood clotting or scabbing because of histones are new events showing a bleeding disorder.
Also, regulating how the environment can cause changes that affect the way genes work and chemical changes of histones appear to be very important in their functions.
In this paper, researchers review the current knowledge of the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss potential anti-histone treatment of these life-threatening disorders.
