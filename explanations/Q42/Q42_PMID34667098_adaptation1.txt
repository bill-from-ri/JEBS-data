What are the types of histone proteins?

Histones make up the chief protein part of DNA.
They help to maintain the structure of chromatin, which helps package the DNA in a compact form so it fits in the cell nucleus (chamber holding the DNA in a cell), and regulate how the instructions from genes are used.
The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around a group of histone proteins to form a structure called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes compact DNA within the cell wall.
There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4.
H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded (given instructions on how to structure it) either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently.
Molecules that combine to build proteins are called amino acids. Some are found in the histone tails and are sites of changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (PTMs).
These changes in histones are involved in regulating how genetic information is used from genes.
Mutations (changes) in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs, causing changes in how genes can be silenced or slowed.
These effects are directly linked to changes in cells by altered genes.
Ongoing changes in H3.3 histone are increasingly identified in several illnesses and developmental disorders.
This review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with H3.3 histone mutations.
