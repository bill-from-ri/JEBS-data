What are the types of histone proteins?

Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (PTMs), are important for regulating chromatin (a substance within a chromosome made up of DNA and protein) and how information from genes are used.
Few studies have investigated all the levels of histone PTMs that are needed for dividing cells, changing their functions, and maintaining these specific cell types.
This study uses an approach called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with another technique called targeted mass spectrometry to detect and sort specific white blood cells that infection.
FACS is used to sort closely and distantly related white blood cells from normal human blood moving throughout the body.
Researchers tested and confirmed the method to sort cells to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone changes.
In healthy donors, histone PTM levels are different in immune cells called T cells, and most of PTMs stay stable for up to 2 days after blood is drawn.
Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are found across the mature, functioning blood cells, though no differences are found in closely related T cell subtypes.
The results show a streamlined approach for identifying changes in histone PTMs in cell types separated by FACS.
