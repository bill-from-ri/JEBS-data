What are the types of histone proteins?

Linker histones are major proteins for organizing DNA and affect the balance of genes.
As the fifth type of histone proteins, the linker histones not only work with DNA and other histones but also other proteins that bind to DNA.
These interactions organize certain DNA regions like DNA loops, DNA expression sites, and nucleus regions with specific DNA segments.
Our recent results show that a specific histone - Hho1p - of brewer's yeast physically interacts with another protein called actin-related protein 4 (Arp4). Removing this interaction via deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global change in DNA binding.
We show that healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is needed for DNA stability and controlling cellular sensitity to different forms of stress.
The removed link between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature aging.
Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress.
These results show the role of linker histones and DNA-protein remodeling in aging by their role in DNA binding and maintaining DNA stability.
