What are the types of histone proteins?

Histones proteins are known for their ability to attach to and regulate how instructions and information from DNA are used to build proteins or other molecules.
However, histones are also present inside and outside cells where they help protect cells and promote inflammatory responses, the body's natural responses to disease or injury.
Histones are a major part of neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) that contribute to killing bacteria but also to inflammatory injury.
Histones can also directly kill bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, outside the body in lab experiments and in a variety of animals.
In addition, histones can trigger inflammatory responses in some cases acting through receptors (target sites) on cells or other receptors and sensors that are part of the immune system.
Histones outside cells help address organ injury (lung or liver) and the process of sepsis which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. It also helps with low blood platelet counts that help the immune system and blood clotting.
