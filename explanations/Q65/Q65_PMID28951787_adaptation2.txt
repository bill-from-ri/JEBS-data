Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

As the study's background, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a harmful behavioural disorder affecting daily ability to function, learn, and interact with peers.
This publication measures the role of omega-3/6 fatty acids in the treatment and management of ADHD.
A review of 16 randomised controlled trials was done.
Trials included a total of 1,514 children and young people with ADHD who were given either an omega-3/6 treatment or a dummy treatment.
Of the studies identified, 13 reported helpful benefits on ADHD symptoms including improvements in hyperactivity, impulsivity, attention, visual learning, word reading, and working/short-term memory.
Four studies used supplements containing a 9 : 3 : 1 ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (omega-3) : docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3) : gamma linolenic acid (omega-6) which appeared effective at improving red blood cell levels.
Supplementation with this ratio of fatty acids also showed promise as a secondary therapy to traditional medications, lowering the dose and improving the compliance with medications such as methylphenidate (stimulant to treat ADHD).
In conclusion, ADHD is a frequent and harmful childhood condition.
Given negative feelings towards psychostimulant medications, omega-3/6 fatty acids offer great promise as a suitable secondary therapy for ADHD.
