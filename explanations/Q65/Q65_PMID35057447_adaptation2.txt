Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Increased infection-fighting (inflammatory) molecules and lasting (chronic) pain are associated with shorter white blood cell gene end or telomere length (LTL), a measure of cellular aging.
Micronutrients, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) and omega 3, have anti-inflammatory properties.
Little is known about the relationships between vitamin D, omega 6:3 ratio, LTL, inflammation, and chronic pain.
We investigate links between vitamin D, omega 6:3 ratio, LTL, and C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of imflammation) in people living with/without chronic pain overall and grouped by chronic pain status.
An analysis of 402 individuals (63% women, 79.5% with chronic pain) was done.
Basic and health information was collected.
Chronic pain was measured as pain experienced for at least three months.
LTL was measured in gene DNA isolated from blood white blood cells, and micronutrients and CRP were measured in blood samples.
Data were analyzed with general mathematical analysis.
Although a link between the continuous micronutrients and LTL was not found, a positive link between omega 6:3 ratio and CRP was detected.
In individuals with chronic pain, based on medical categories, significant links between vitamin D, omega 6:3 ratio, and CRP were observed.
Findings show the complex relationships between anti-inflammatory micronutrients, inflammation, cellular aging, and chronic pain.
