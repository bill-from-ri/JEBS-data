Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Maternal obesity is linked with harmful offspring outcomes.
Inflammation (infection-fighting processes) and lack of anti-inflammatory nutrients like omega(n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may contribute to these links.
Fetal supply of n-3 PUFA is dependent on maternal levels. Studies have suggested that improved offspring results are linked with higher maternal intake.
However, little is known about how maternal obesity affects the response to n-3 supplementation during pregnancy.
We sought to determine (1) the links of obesity with PUFA concentrations and (2) if the full-body response to n-3 supplementation differs by body mass index (BMI).
This was a secondary analysis of 556 participants (46% lean, 28% obese) in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network trial of n-3 (Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) + Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) - specific omega-3 fatty acids) supplementation, in which participants had 2g/day of n-3 or sham treatment from 19 to 22 weeks until delivery.
At start, obese women had higher blood n-6 arachidonic acid (specific omega-6 fatty acid) concentrations and n-6/n-3 ratio compared to lean women.
In the adjusted analysis, women in all BMI groups had higher n-3 concentrations following supplementation, although obese women had reduced changes compared to lean women, resulting in a 50% difference.
Similarly, obese women also had a smaller reduction in the n-6/n-3 ratio (marker of inflammatory status), which was 65% lower compared to lean women.
Obesity is linked with higher inflammation and with a weakened response to n-3 supplementation in pregnancy.
