Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

As background for this study, atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a common childhood disease, potentially influenced by pre-birth nutritional exposures such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
As the objective for this study, in a racially diverse group, we hypothesized that childhood atopic dermatitis would be linked with higher pre-birth omega-6 (n-6) and lower omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs.
We included mother-child groups, births 2006 to 2011, enrolled in the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive (brain-related intelligence) Development in Early Childhood group.
Main events included second trimester blood n-3 and n-6 PUFA status and the ratio of the two (n-6:n-3).
We measured child current atopic dermatitis symptoms in the previous 12 months of age approximately 4 to 6 years.
We investigated the link between PUFA exposures and atopic dermatitis using mathematical analysis.
We measured for effect modification by maternal pre-birth smoking, atopic (allergy-related) disease history, and child sex.
The results include among 1131 women, 67% were African American and 42% had an atopic disease history; 17% of children had atopic dermatitis.
Higher pre-birth n-6 PUFAs were linked with increased relative odds of child atopic dermatitis, and statistical models show that this link was seen in two-member groups in which the women had a history of atopic disease.
Neither pre-birth n-3 PUFAs nor n-6:n-3 were linked with child atopic dermatitis.
In conclusion, in this racially diverse cohort, higher second trimester n-6 PUFAs were linked with atopic dermatitis in children of women with atopy.
PUFAs may represent a modifiable risk factor for atopic dermatitis, especially in individuals with an inherited risk factor.
