Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

As the study's background, the ω-6 (n-6) to ω-3 (n-3) fatty acid (FA) ratio (n-6:n-3 ratio) was previously shown to be a predictor of brain function performance in children aged 7-9 y.
For the objective, we aimed to replicate and extend previous findings by exploring the role of the n-6:n-3 ratio in brain function performance.
We hypothesized that there would be an link between n-3 and the n-6:n-3 ratio, with children with low n-3 performing best with a low ratio, and those with high n-3 performing best with a high ratio.
For the study design, children were recruited on the basis of their consumption of n-6 and n-3 FAs.
The brain function performance of 78 children aged 7-12 y was tested with the use of specific brain health tests and a planning task.
Participants provided blood for FA quantification, and the caregiver completed basic background and activity questionnaires.
We investigated the role of the n-6:n-3 ratio in the entire sample and separately in children aged 7-9 y and 10-12 y.
For the study results, diet and blood n-6:n-3 ratio and n-3 predicted performance on short-term memory and planning tasks in children 7-12 y old.
The link between dietary n-6:n-3 ratio and n-3 predicted the number of moves required to solve the most difficult planning problems in children aged 7-9 y and those aged 10-12 y, similar to results from the previous study.
There was also a link between the blood n-6:n-3 ratio and n-3 predicting time spent thinking through the difficult 5-move planning problems.
The n-6:n-3 ratio and n-3 predicted brain function performance differently in children aged 7-9 y and in those aged 10-12 y, indicating different optimal FA balances across age.
In conclusion, the n-6:n-3 ratio is an important factor in the role of FAs in brain function. The optimal balance of n-6 and n-3 FAs depends on the brain function and age period studied.
