Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved both in immune system regulation and inflammation.
In particular, within the PUFAs category, omega-3 (ω-3) may reduce inflammation, whereas omega-6 (ω-6) PUFAs are generally considered to have a proinflammatory effect.
Recent evidence highlights an imbalance in the ω-3:ω-6 ratio with an increased intake of ω-6, as a consequence of the shift towards a westernized diet.
In critical age groups such as infants, toddlers and young children, as well as pregnant and lactating women or fish allergic patients, ω-3 intake may be inadequate.
This review aims to discuss the potential beneficial effects of PUFAs on pediatric food allergy prevention and treatment, both at prenatal and postnatal ages.
Data from preclinical studies with PUFAs supplementation show encouraging effects in suppressing allergic response.
Clinical studies results are still conflicting about the best timing and dosages of supplementation and which individuals are most likely to benefit; therefore, it is still not possible to draw firm conclusions.
With regard to food-allergic children, it is still debated whether PUFAs could slow disease progression or not, since consistent data are lacking.
In conclusion, more data on the effects of ω-3 PUFAs supplementation alone or in combination with other nutrients are warranted, both in the general and food allergic population.
