Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

For this study's background, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women around the world and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women.
The knowledge about changeable risk factors, such as diet, can be an acceptable, cheap and non-drug prevention tool.
The aim of this study was to check the link between dietary fat, dietary fatty acids, fish intake, and breast cancer in women.
A patient study was designed.
A total of 201 newly diagnosed, polish female cancer patients (average age: 58 years) and 201 age-matched patients without cancer were included.
A standard questionnaire measuring various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics was applied via face-to-face interviews.
Detailed dietary intake information was measured using a verified diet questionnaire.
Results were obtained using statistical models controlling for non-dietary and dietary potential confounders.
Consumption of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) over 10% of total energy intake was linked with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared to low intake of PUFA.
Low (<0.2) omega-3/ omega-6 ratio, fish consumption less than once every six months and being overweight were linked with increased risk of breast cancer.
Residents of rural areas had a much higher risk compared to women from urban areas.
In conclusion, high intake of PUFA can decrease the risk of breast cancer, while the low omega-3/omega-6 ratio increases the risk.
In addition, being overweight, eliminating fish from the diet and living in rural areas can also increase the risk of breast cancer.
