Ratio of omega 6's to omega 3's; how important is it?

Background/aim: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women around the world and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women.
The knowledge about modifiable risk factors, such as diet, can be an acceptable, cheap and non-pharmacological prevention tool.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary fat, dietary fatty acids, fish intake, and breast cancer in women.
Patients and methods: A case-control study was designed.
A total of 201 consecutive, newly diagnosed, polish female cancer patients (mean age: 58 years) and 201 one-to-one age-matched controls were enrolled.
A standardized questionnaire assessing various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics was applied via face-to-face interviews.
Detailed dietary intake information was assessed using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire.
Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were obtained using multiple unconditional logistic regression models controlling for non-dietary and dietary potential confounders.
Results: Consumption of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) over 10% of total energy intake was associated with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared to low intake of PUFA (OR=0.4, 95%CI=0.19-0.85).
Low (<0.2) omega-3/ omega-6 ratio (OR=2.04, 95%CI=0.996-4.17), fish consumption less than once every six months (OR=3.37, 95%CI=1.57-7.23) and being overweight (OR=2.07, 95%CI=1.3-3.3) were associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
Residents of rural areas had a significantly higher risk compared to women from urban areas (OR=1.8, 95%CI=1.06-3.03).
Conclusion: High intake of PUFA can decrease the risk of breast cancer, while the low omega-3/omega-6 ratio increases the risk.
In addition, overweight state, eliminating fish from the diet and living in rural areas can also increase the risk of breast cancer.
