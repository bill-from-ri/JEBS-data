How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

In poisoning caused by swallowing a toxic substance once or many times over a short period of time, any first aid assistance that reduces or delays how much is swallowed, and which ones bystanders can do, might help in reducing illness.
The International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies recommends a victim be placed on the person's left side.
We conclude that the studies provide unreliable results.
However, based on studies that show placing a person on the person's left side may decrease absorption of many drugs, and the ease and low risk of doing so, the recommendation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies stands.
