How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Background: Oral poisoning is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with estimates of over 100,000 deaths due to unintentional poisoning each year and an overrepresentation of children below five years of age.
Any effective intervention that laypeople can apply to limit or delay uptake or to evacuate, dilute or neutralize the poison before professional help arrives may limit toxicity and save lives.
Objectives: To assess the effects of pre-hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help.
Authors' conclusions: The studies included in this review provided mostly low- or very low-certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning.
A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre-hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting.
Thus, the amount of evidence collected was insufficient to draw any conclusions.
