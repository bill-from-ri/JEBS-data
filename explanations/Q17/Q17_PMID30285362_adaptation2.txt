How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Abdominal thrusts or the Heimlich manuever is a first-aid procedure for airway blockage due to something being stuck in throat.
Abdominal thrusts are usually taught during basic life support (BLS) and advanced cardiac, or heart-related, life support (ACLS) classes, but it never gets as much attention as chest squeezes and mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths do.
Abdominal thrusts can be used on both children and adults via different ways.
In the 1960s, choking on objects was the sixth leading cause of accidental death in the US.
Slapping others on the back was the main treatment and found to not be useful, sometimes forcing the object further down.
Abdominal thrusts were introduced in 1974 by Dr. Henry Heimlich after proving his theory that air in the lungs could remove objects in the airway by quick upward thrusts under the ribs.
The medical groups of the time did not employ the technique right away.
The American Red Cross (ARC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) still used backslaps for ten years after the introduction of abdominal thrusts.
Today, abdominal thrusts are accepted and taught during basic and advanced cardiac, or heart-related, life support classes. Still, backslaps are approved for infants and chest compressions for unconscious patients.
Also, different techniques of abdominal thrusts have been created with conflicting success.
