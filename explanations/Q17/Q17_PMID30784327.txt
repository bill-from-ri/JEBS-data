How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Introduction: In acute oral poisoning, any first aid intervention that limits or delays the uptake of the ingested substance, and which can be performed by bystanders as first responders, might assist in reducing morbidity if a toxic substance has been ingested.
The current recommendation by the International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies is to place a victim in the left lateral decubitus position.
Conclusions: The identified studies provide evidence of very low certainty.
However, based on the evidence that the left lateral decubitus position may be effective in decreasing the absorption of several drugs, the simplicity of the intervention and the generally low perceived risk of this intervention, the recommendation of the first aid guidelines of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies can remain unchanged.
