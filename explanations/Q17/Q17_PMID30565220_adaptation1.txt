How do you assist an unconscious victim who is already vomiting?

Poisoning caused by swallowing a toxic substance is a big cause of death and disability worldwide, with over 100,000 deaths due to accidental poisoning each year largely from children younger than five years.
Anything that bystanders can do to reduce or delay how much is swallowed or to make ineffective, make weaker, or remove the poison before professional help arrives may limit the harm and save lives.
Our objectives were to measure the effects of pre-hospital treatments (alone or in combination) for treating poisoning caused by swallowing a toxic substance that are available to and doable for bystanders before professional help arrives.
We concluded that the studies we looked at had mostly unreliable findings about the use of first aid treatments for poisoning caused by swallowing a toxic substance once or many times over a short period of time.
An important limitation was that only one study happened in a pre-hospital setting, which does not make us confident that these results apply to this setting.
Therefore, there were not enough results to draw any conclusions.
