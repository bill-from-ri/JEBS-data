What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics.
While prevention is the best approach, it is not always possible.
This report lists approaches to reduce TD symptoms, including the use of treatments options approved by the FDA (such as the drugs valbenazine and deutetrabenazine).
