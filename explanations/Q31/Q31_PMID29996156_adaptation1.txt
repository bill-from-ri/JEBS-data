What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesias (TDs) - movement disorders - are still common long-term consequences of antipsychotic drugs.
TDs generally cannot be reversed and are linked with intellectual disabilities, decreased quality of life and increased death.
Furthermore, TDs possibly cause patients to be viewed more negatively by society.
Because of a lack of treatment options, antipsychotic drugs are still one of the main treatments for serious mental illness.
Therefore, knowing about TD risk factors and prevention is very important.
IF TDs happen, the amount of antipsychotic drugs prescribed must be changed quickly to an appropriate amount.
Specialized drugs such as vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT - 2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), can be used.
Germany has not yet approved the new VMAT-2 inhibitors.
Clonazepam and gingko biloba, used for seizures and memory problems, respectively, are other drugs that can be used to treat TDs.
We summarize the current data on TD treatment options and try to come up with recommendations for doctors to prevent and treat TDs.
