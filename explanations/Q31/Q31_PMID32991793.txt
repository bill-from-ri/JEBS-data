What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a condition of potentially irreversible abnormal involuntary movements associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents, such as antipsychotics.
While prevention is the best strategy, it is not always possible.
This report outlines strategies to reduce TD symptoms, including the use of the FDA-approved treatment options (valbenazine and deutetrabenazine).
