What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive duskinesia is a movement disorder of irregular, repetitive, and jerking movements linked with using antipsychotic medication for treating mental illnesses.
We aim to provide recommendation on treating tardive dyskinesia.
Preventing tardive dyskinesia is very important. Clinicians should follow the best policies for prescribing antipsychotic medication. These include limiting the amount for specific symptoms, using the minimum effective dose, and minimising the duration of treatment.
The first-to-try treatment of tardive dyskinesia is removing antipsychotic medication if clinically possible.
Yet, for many patients with serious mental illness, removing antipsychotics is not possible due to disease reappearance.
Switching from one class to another class of antipsychotics, like clozapine or quetiapine, may help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms.
The strongest evidence for a suitable co-treatment for tardive dyskinesia comes from tests with new VMAT inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, which treat movement disorders.
These drugs have not been approved for use in Canada.
Data on tardive dyskinesia treatment is limited. The best treatment remains prevention.
We need more long-term safety and effectiveness data for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. Their regular availability to patients outside the USA is unknown.
