What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Purpose of review: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is caused by exposure to medications with dopamine antagonism, mainly antipsychotics.
It often distresses individuals, physically and emotionally and affects their quality of life.
We evaluated peer-reviewed recently published articles with a goal of providing a critically appraised update on the latest advancements in this field.
Recent findings: In 2017, FDA approved VMAT2 inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine.
They have demonstrated efficacy in several class 1 studies.
Also there have been update in the evidence-based guidelines for treatment for tardive dyskinesia.
Various medication classes are being used for treatment of TD with VMAT2 inhibitors to be first FDA-approved medications.
Their use should be tailored to the individual patient.
Long-term studies will further guide us in how to optimize treatment, especially in the real-world setting.
As clinicians, we need to take into consideration all aspects of symptomatology, etiology, potential side effects of the medications, to find the best possible "match" for our patients.
