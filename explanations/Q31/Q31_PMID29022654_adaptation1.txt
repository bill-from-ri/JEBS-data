What medications are used to treat tardive dyskinesia?

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is characterized by uncontrolled movements, usually of the face muscles and also of the arms, legs, and other muscles.
TD is related to antipsychotic use.
Because reasons to prescribe and unapproved uses for antipsychotics have increased, more patients are taking antipsychotic drugs than in the past.
Although data suggest that patients taking second-generation (newer) antipsychotics are less likely to develop TD than those taking first-generation (older) antipsychotics, the decreased risk is not as great as originally thought.
In addition, patients with long-term mental conditions often need long-term antipsychotics use, putting them at risk for TD.
This article looks at the total number of TD cases at a given time, risk factors, and prevention of TD; ways to measure TD including signs and symptoms and questionnaires; and TD treatments, including 2 newly approved drugs: deutetrabenazine and valbenazine.
