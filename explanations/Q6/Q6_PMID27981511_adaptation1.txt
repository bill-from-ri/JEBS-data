What is the best thyroid drug?

Our objective is to summarize the history, understanding of how they work, and patient health changes seen with thyroid hormone replacement treatments.
We searched Medline using the search terms, levothyroxine, thyroid hormone history, levothyroxine mono therapy, thyroid hormone replacement, combination LT4 therapy, levothyroxine Bioequivalence. Both levothyroxine and LT4 are synthetic thryoid hormones.
We identified important papers by title and abstract to look at more closely when possible.
We found more references while reading the important papers.
Doctors have treated overactive and underactive thyroids for more than 2000 years.
Taking forms of medicine that come from animal thyroid glands has been described for a long time but only written about in scientific papers for the last 130 years.
Improvements in hormone medication preparation, drug production and drug laws continue to this day.
Normal body function, disease, and patient health effects are described and updated regularly in scientific papers.
Using these hormones to successfully and safely undo changes to body function and improve other symptoms of an underactive thyroid shows our improved understanding of their use.
Better patient care has resulted from studies of thyroid hormone metabolism, how it works, and what the body does to it.
The use of a single drug, levothyroxine, has become the top thyroid medicine based on recent major guidelines.
