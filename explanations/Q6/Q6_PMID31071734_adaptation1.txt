What is the best thyroid drug?

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common type of disease caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and results in an underactive thyroid.
Recently, science has shown vitamin D can change how normal and cancer cells grow, divide, and change from one cell to another, how the heart works, and how the body's immune system changes.
Too little vitamin D is seen in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
This study aimed to determine the effect of vitamin D on thyroid autoantibodies (substances that develop when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid) and thyroid hormone (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels in women.
We split 42 women with HT disease into two groups and gave one group vitamin D and the other group sham treatment.
We gave one group 50,000 international units of vitamin D and the other group sugar pills for 3 months.
We measured blood levels of thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) at the beginning and end of the study using a common antibody-measuring tool.
Blood levels of one antibody and thyroid-stimulating hormone were lower at the end of the study in the group taking vitamin D. The group taking vitamin D and the group taking sugar pills had similar blood levels of another antibody.
Blood levels of T3 and T4 hormones did not change in either group.
Therefore, taking vitamin D can help people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, more large studies done over time are needed to see if it can be used in patient care.
