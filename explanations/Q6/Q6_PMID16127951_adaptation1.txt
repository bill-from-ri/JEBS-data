What is the best thyroid drug?

Successfully treating an overactive thyroid depends on identifying the signs and symptoms of the disease and determining the cause.
Graves' disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells, is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid.
Other common causes of an overactive thyroid include thyroid inflammation, one or more glandular growths making extra thyroid hormone, and side effects of some medications.
A common test that measures blood levels of hormones that acts as messengers to the thyroid is the first step in a medical exam.
When results of this test are uncertain, a test to measure thyroid function can be used.
When the cause is inflammation of the thyroid, treating the symptoms is enough because the overactive thyroid is short-lived.
Graves' disease and when one or more growths make extra thyroid hormone can be treated with radiation therapy, drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, or surgery. In the United States, radiation therapy to shrink the thyroid is preferred unless there is a reason not to do so.
Thyroid removal is an option when other treatments do not work or should not be used, or when an enlarged thyroid is causing pressure or squeezing.
New treatments are being studied.
People who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with thyroid eye disease or overactive thyroids caused by amiodarone, a heart medication, must be given special treatment consideration.
We must factor in what patients want when deciding on treatment. Maintaining a safe and effective dose is very important.
