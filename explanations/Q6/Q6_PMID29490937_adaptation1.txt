What is the best thyroid drug?

Underactive thyroid is one of the most common conditions caused by a lack of specific hormones in adults.
Underactive thyroid is usually easily identified and successfully treated.
However, small changes in thyroid function determine symptoms that can be caused by many conditions.
Primary underactive thyroid caused by a long-term inflamed thyroid, which in turn is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, is the most common cause of too little thyroid hormones in adults.
Central underactive thyroid, which is not very common and has many causes, is when an otherwise normal thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone due to lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone.
Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4) is the normal treatment of primary and central underactive thyroid.
Treatment guidelines for an underactive thyroid recommend a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4), because of how well it works, how long it has been used, few side effects, how easy it is to use, how well it is absorbed in the stomach, how long it lasts in the blood, and low cost.
Although taking LT4 daily treats underactive thyroid, many people still have underactive thyroids due to conditions that do not allow absorption in the stomach, inflammation of the stomach lining caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, pancreatic and live disease, two or more drugs interacting with each other, gene variations, eating too much fiber, and more commonly, not following the prescribed LT4 treatment.
Taking levothyroxine as prescribed for underactive thyroid depends on when and if it is taken on an empty stomach.
For all of these reasons, many adults still have underactive thyroids. Doctors have tried many ways to make people take levothyroxine as prescribed and make levothyroxine more easily absorbed in the stomach.
