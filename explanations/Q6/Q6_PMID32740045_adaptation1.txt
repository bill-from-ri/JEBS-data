What is the best thyroid drug?

This article aims to cover the basics of how well levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication) is absorbed when taken by mouth, reasons why people may have continuously high blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, and other ways to take levothyroxine.
Although LT4 tablets taken by mouth are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in people with underactive thyroids, studies show that taking LT4 in liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, and through the rectum can work to treat poorly-controlled underactive thyroid.
Underactive thyroid is one of the most common hormone disorders doctors see.
LT4 is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and is the recommended treatment for underactive thyroid.
Generally, people with underactive thyroids will take LT4 tablets by mouth and track thryoid levels with common blood thyroid tests, including measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone.
Taking LT4 tablets by mouth does not keep blood thyroid-stimulating hormone levels at the right level for many people.
Some of these people may have poorly-controlled underactive thyroids, or refractory underactive thyroids.
This group of people might need to take LT4 in other forms or other ways, including liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, or even through the rectum.
