What is the best thyroid drug?

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid.
More people around the world are taking Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, as a nontraditional way to treat many long-term diseases including high cholesterol, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
The current study aimed to rate the effects of Nigella sativa on how well the thyroid is working, blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1 (a protein that promotes new blood vessels), Nesfatin-1 (a chain of amino acids that affects hunger) and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
We randomly split forty people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and between 22 and 50 years old into two group and gave one group powdered Nigella sativa and the other group sham treatment for 8 weeks.
We measured changes in physical body measurements, what people ate, thyroid function, blood VEGF and Nefastin-1 levels after 8 weeks.
Taking Nigella sativa caused lower body weight and body mass index (BMI).
People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and antibodies that target the thyroid and higher levels of blood thyroid hormone (T4) after 8 weeks.
People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of VEGF.
None of these changes were seen in the group who took the sham treatmentl.
Based on a statistical model, changes in the ratio of the waist to the hip and thyroid hormones predicted changes in blood VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 levels in the group who took Nigella sativa.
We concluded that powdered Nigella sativa improved thyroid function and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Nigella sativa lowered blood VEGF levels.
Nigella sativa can be a useful non-traditional treatment for people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis to make the disease less severe.
