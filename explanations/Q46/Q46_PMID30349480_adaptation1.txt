How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Changes in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common life-shortening diseases affecting organs that make and release substances into transporting ducts.
The absence of this protein from the CFTR gene causes an imbalance of ion (charged atom) concentrations across the cell membrane and causes release and buildup of abnormally high levels of mucus in the digestive tract and lungs of CF patients.
Scientists have tried transferring working CFTR into a patient's cells regardless of the specific CFTR gene change, but patient trials were not successful.
New drugs that can stimulate CFTR function based on the specific gene change have been made in the last ten years.
Of the roughly 2,000 different gene changes linked to CF, the most common change is F508del, a deletion of a sequence of three consecutive gene compounds, and about 70% of people with CF have at least one form of it.
Chemistry, CFTR knowledge, and genetic differences of patients limit the ability to stimulate CFTR function based on the specific gene change.
New CF research aims to develop other treatments that combine different approaches.
Looking at RNA (which changes the genetic information of DNA into proteins) is a new and important chance to fix incorrectly functioning biological processes.
Scientists have linked abnormal microRNA (miRNA; short type of non-coding RNA that does not encode a protein) to many diseases, and over the last decade, scientists have developed interest in how miRNA interacts with specific proteins.
We describe different ways to find incorrectly functioning miRNA that might help correct lack of CFTR.
This review describes RNA treatments currently being studied in CF.
