How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Cells on the surface of the bronchi (two tubes that carry air to your lungs) extracted from humans and grown in the lab are a valuable tool to study lung disease such as cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited disease caused by a change in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein which helps transport chloride.
In CF, sphingolipids, a common type of lipids found in cell surroundings, seem to play an important role in the onset of serious lung problems.
Yet information is lacking on the involvement of sphingolipids and their metabolism (digestion) in the process by which cells on the surface of the bronchi change their type.
Two types of sphingolipids increased and two decreased as dividing cells changed type.
Cells on the surface of the bronchi have more sphingolipids compared to surfaces of other cells.
The surface of CF cells had high levels of two sphingolipids, known to promote inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection).
Our results support the role of sphingolipids in the onset of CF lung problems.
