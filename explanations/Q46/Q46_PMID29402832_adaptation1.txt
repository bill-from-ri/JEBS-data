How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

The CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL) reduces the cell surface of normal CFTR through destroying it in a well-understood way. The CFTR protein is a channel involved with movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of the internal organs).
However, few scientists have studied how CAL controls ΔF508 CFTR, a specific gene sequence change seen in the CFTR gene which slightly alters the CFTR protein.
In this study, we describe a previously unknown way CAL controls ΔF508 CFTR through stopping ΔF508 CFTR movement in the cell's transportation system.
We show that CAL binds to ΔF508 CFTR in one location of the cell and is destroyed in another location of the cell.
When CAL is stopped, the amount of ΔF508 CFTR held within the cell decreases and working ΔF508 CFTR is seen on the cell surface.
The binding of ΔF508 CFTR to proteins improves the cell surface movement conducted by ΔF508 CFTR.
We conclude that CAL controls the cell surface availability and amount held within the cell of ΔF508 CFTR.
