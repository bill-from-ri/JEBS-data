How does cystic fibrosis affect cell membrane?

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease, which leads to mucus buildup in many organs, caused by mutations in a specific gene, which encodes a channel located at the surface of boundary cells.
Lack of Unsaturated Fatty Acid (UFA), a certain form of fat, has been a common observation for patients with CF.
However, the effects of such deficiencies on the causes of the disease are debated.
This review aims to highlight the general consensus on fatty acid impairment that comes from, sometimes contradictory, studies.
In a second step, how the possible effects of this fatty acid impairment occur in CF cells, based on changes in cell boundary properties, is explored.
Finally, how fat toxicity contribtues to progression of the CF disease and affects the success of current treatments is discussed.
