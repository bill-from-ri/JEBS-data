What are prevention suggestions and strategies pertaining to postpartum depression?

Postnatal depression (depression after childbirth) is a major public health problem. It affects about one in seven women after childbirth.
Depression is also common during pregnancy and throughout the perinatal period (time of pregnancy and after childbirth ). it is associated with symptoms of anxiety.
There are harmful effects for women themselves to become depressed when they are going through demanding physical and social changes. But there are also other concerns.
Maternal depression can cause problems with the relationship between mother and child. There can also be problems with the child's emotional, behavioral and cognitive (thinking) development.
Prevention and early interventions may be important in view of the frequent contact pregnant women, new mothers and infants have with health services. The effectiveness of these interventions needs to be tested.
In the past year there have been five new studies of antenatal (during pregnancy) screening for postnatal depression.
These studies agree with nine earlier studies showing that there is no evidence to support routine antenatal screening for postnatal depression.
Seven new prevention and early intervention studies add evidence on a wide range of treatments ranging from practical support to individual interpersonal therapy.  These studies have not found significant differences in the outcome of depression.
Two new studies on the prevention of the recurrence of depression show promise of success. One invention study involves interpersonal therapy and the other includes partners in psychoeducational visits. Neither study is large enough to form a basis for practice change.
New interventions, or promising findings, with a strong basis in theory need to be tested in trials (human studies) which are large enough and which meet internationally accepted standards and guidelines.
