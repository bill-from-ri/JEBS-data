What are prevention suggestions and strategies pertaining to postpartum depression?

Depression after giving birth, postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health problem. PPD affects 10-57% of adolescent mothers. It can affect not only adolescent mothers but also their infants.
There is a need for treatments to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers.
Recent thorough reviews of studies on preventing PPD  have been focused on successful treatments in adult mothers.
These treatments to prevent PPD may not necessarily apply to adolescent mothers.
This research judged the benefit of accepted treatments to prevent PPD in adolescent mothers.
A thorough search was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases (organized collection of articles including health topics) to find English language articles written between January 2000 and March 2017 on studies involving human subjects.
Studies reporting on the outcomes of intervention (treatment) to prevent PPD particularly in adolescent mothers were selected.
Researchers did not include studies that were not comparative studies.
Of the 2002 articles found, researchers included 13 studies. These 13 studies included information on a total of 2236 adolescent pregnant women.
Six out of 13 studies suggests interventions are successful in lowering rates of PPD symptoms in adolescent mothers (compared to the group that did not receive interventions). The research was from the psychological and social intervention studies. The interventions included: home visits; education (before, during, and after pregnancy and childbirth); psychological therapy; interpersonal therapy, and infant massage training.
These interventions might be included in maternity care for adolescent pregnant women.
This research did not find out the most successful intervention to prevent postpartum depression in adolescent mothers.
