What bp meds should not be taken if person has mthfr genetic variant?

Genetic and clinical studies have linked variation in a specific DNA sequence for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a certain protein, with high blood pressure. Some evidence shows that treatment with riboflavin (a molecule that attaches to MTHFR) can lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with high blood pressure and an altered DNA sequence for MTHFR called 677TT.
We tested the impact of this altered DNA sequence on BP through adulthood. We believed that riboflavin would affect the genetic risk of high blood pressure.

Patients were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in 2008-2012.
The altered DNA sequence of MTHFR 677TT was found in 12% of adults.
From 18 to 70 years, this altered DNA sequence, or genotype, was linked with increased risk of high blood pressure after adjusting for blood pressure medication use, age, sex, body mass, alcohol, total cholesterol, and other factors.
Low or no riboflavin (seen in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) worsened the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients with a certain genotype along with no riboflavin had a 3-fold increased risk compared to patients with the standard genotype along with normal riboflavin.
Up to 65 years, we saw poorer BP control rates on anti-high-BP treatment in participants with a certain DNA sequence for MTHFR compared to those without this altered DNA sequence.
A specific gentoype for MTHFR is linked with higher BP regardless of homocysteine, a molecule that MTHFR acts on, and biases adults to increased risk of high BP and poorer BP control with anti-high-BP treatment. Better riboflavin amount is linked with reduced genetic risk.
Riboflavin treatment may thus give an individualized approach to prevent high BP in adults with a certain genotype for MTHFR. Still, this needs confirmation in a trial in adults without high BP.
