What bp meds should not be taken if person has mthfr genetic variant?

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY), when there is excess homocysteine in the blood, is a risk factor for cardiovascular, or blood- and heart-related, and cerebrovascular, or blood- and brain-related, diseases. Homocysteine is an intermediate amino acid (molecule that form proteins).
A specific genetic variation or gene change, known as  C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism, which alters the MTHFR protein involved in blood pressure, increases homocysteine (HCY) levels.
This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR variation and the therapeutic, beneficial effect (response after a treatment) of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY.
Baseline data, meaning prior to treatment, was collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this study.
The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected, and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared.
Of 200 stroke patients, 162 completed follow-up and were evaluated.
Most of them responded well to treatment, but 59 patients were in the poor efficacy or poor effect group.
There was a significant difference in terms of age, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperuricemia (high uric acid or waste), HCY after treatment, and MTHFR genotype between the poor efficacy and effective groups. The poor efficacy group had more participated with TT genotype of the genetic variant.
Statistical analysis showed that the T allele (an alternative form of a gene) was associated with poor efficacy.
The TT genotype was associated with poor outcomes.
The study concluded the T allele and TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T genetic variation was associated with poor HCY reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with HHCY.
