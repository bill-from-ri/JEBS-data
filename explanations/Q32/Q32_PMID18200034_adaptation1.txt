What bp meds should not be taken if person has mthfr genetic variant?

Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs (that treat high blood pressure), like diuretics, increase plasma or blood homocysteine (Hcy) levels. Hcy is am amino acid that creates other chemicals your body needs.
However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively.
The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. Essential hypertensive patients have high blood pressure that is not the result of a medical condition.
A study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 patients with normal blood pressure was begun.
Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT.
Patients were genotyped to analyze a specific genetic variation or gene material.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that lower blood pressure by relaxing veins and arteries. Beta-blockers are drugs that lower blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decrease plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. Hydrochlorothiazides, or "water pills", significantly increase plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients.
There was no association between the identified genetic variation and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive within EH patients.
The observed decrease in Hcy caused by ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be due to the improvement of endothelial (tissue lining various organs and cavities in the body) and kidney function.
Therefore, this study suggests that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional, beneficial or therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.
