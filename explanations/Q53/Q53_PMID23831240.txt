Why do blood sugars become elevated in the afternoon?

Objectives: Afternoon napping is a common habit in China.
We used data obtained from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort to examine if duration of habitual afternoon napping was associated with risks for impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in a Chinese elderly population.
Methods: A total of 27,009 participants underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, and face-to-face interview.
They were categorized into four groups according to nap duration (no napping, <30, 30 to <60, 60 to <90, and > or =90 min).
Logistic regression models were used to examine the odds ratios (ORs) of napping duration with IFG and DM.
Results: Of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps.
Those with longer nap duration had considerably higher prevalence of IFG and DM.
Napping duration was associated in a dose-dependent manner with IFG and DM (P<.001).
After adjusting for possible confounders, longer nap duration (>60 min; all P<.05) was still significantly associated with increased risk for IFG, and longer nap duration (>30 min) was associated with increased risk for DM; however, this finding was not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 min.
Conclusions: Longer habitual afternoon napping was associated with a moderate increase for DM risk, independent of several covariates.
This finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a novel risk factor for DM and higher blood glucose levels.
