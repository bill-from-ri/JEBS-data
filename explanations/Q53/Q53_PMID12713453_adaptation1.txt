Why do blood sugars become elevated in the afternoon?

In diabetic patients, blood sugar levels after meals, which have a major impact on how nutrients in the body are used, are determined by several factors: the rate of nutrient delivery into the stomach, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine that helps further digestion of food, and the metabolism of the nutrients absorbed by the liver.
The present study addresses whether Type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability, the control of material passing from the stomach and to the rest of the body, and how intestinal permeability predicts different levels of blood sugar after meals.
Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients and 15 healthy people as controls (comparison group) are enrolled in the study.
After an overnight fasting (no food), all patients and controls receive a substance called EDTA that allows internal images of the body to be seen, and the amount of the substance released in a 24-hour urine sample is how intestinal permeability is measured.
During the following week, instant blood sugar is measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and blood sugar levels 2 hours after meals.
Researchers found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with healthy controls.
Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood sugar level and the presence of a type of nerve damage that can occur with diabetes.
Increased intestinal permeability that allows substances to pass from the stomach to the body leads to higher differences in post-meal blood sugar levels, thereby worsening the body's ability to control the use and distribution of nutrients.
