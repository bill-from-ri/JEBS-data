Why do blood sugars become elevated in the afternoon?

The objective of this study is to determine the effect of morning exercise after fasting (no food or drink except water for 8 to 10 hours) vs afternoon exercise on blood sugar responses to resistance exercise, also known as strength or weight training to build muscle.
In this study, 12 participants with type 1 diabetes perform about 40 minutes of resistance exercise (three sets of eight repetitions, seven exercises) at either 7 am (fasting) or 5 pm.
Sessions are performed at least 48 hours apart.
Blood samples are collected immediately before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 60 minutes after exercise.
Interstitial sugar is taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues rather the blood. Interstitial sugar is monitored overnight after exercise by using continuous sugar monitoring device.

Blood sugar rises during fasting morning exercise, whereas it declined with afternoon exercise.
Sixty minutes after exercise, blood sugar is significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise.
Data from the continuous sugar monitoring device indicated more changes in sugar levels and more frequent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) after morning resistance exercise than after afternoon resistance exercise.
Compared with afternoon resistance exercise, morning (fasting) resistance exercise is associated with distinctly different blood sugar responses and post-exercise responses.
