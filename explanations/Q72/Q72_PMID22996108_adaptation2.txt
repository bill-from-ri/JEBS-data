What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

Newborn screening is the largest genetic screening program in the United States with approximately four million newborns screened every year.
It has been available and continuously being improved for more than 50 years.
Each state manages, funds, and maintains its own individual program. This involves newborn screening as well as the diagnosis and coordination of care for affected infants and children.
The ideal disorder for screening is one where taking action for newborns that appear normal prevents later disabilities or death.
There are 31 main conditions that are currently recommended for inclusion in state screening programs.
To get a sample, several drops of blood are collected from the newborn's heel and applied to filter paper.
Testing for the main disorders is fairly standardized. However, more extensive screening varies by state. Additionally, new disorders are always being carefully considered for being included in state screening panels.
Healthcare based on genetics is becoming more widely available. As this happens we need to think about screening newborns for chronic diseases that may affect their long-term health. We also need to think about the use of the leftover blood spots for research.
At some time during pregnancy, obstetricians should review the basic process of newborn screening with parents to prepare them for this testing when the child is born.
Reviewing this information can depend on how it fits into each doctorâ€™s individual practice. Talking with patients and giving out of written materials with resources for further information are encouraged.
