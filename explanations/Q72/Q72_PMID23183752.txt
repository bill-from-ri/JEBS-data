What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

Newborn screening (NBS) of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is a coordinated comprehensive system consisting of education, screening, follow-up of abnormal test results, confirmatory testing, diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of periodic outcome and efficiency.
The ultimate goal of NBS and follow-up programs is to reduce morbidity and mortality from the disorders.
Over the past decade, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become a key technology in the field of NBS.
It has replaced classic screening techniques of one-analysis, one-metabolite, one-disease with one analysis, many-metabolites, and many-diseases.
The development of electrospray ionization (ESI), automation of sample handling and data manipulation have allowed the introduction of expanded NBS for the identification of numerous conditions on a single sample and new conditions to be added to the list of disorders being screened for using MS/MS.
In the case of a screened positive result, a follow-up analytical test should be performed for confirmation of the primary result.
The most common confirmatory follow-up tests are amino acids and acylcarnitine analysis in plasma and organic acid analysis in urine.
NBS should be integrated with follow-up and clinical management.
Recent improvements in therapy have caused some disorders to be considered as potential candidates for NBS.
This review covers some of the basic theory of expanded MS/MS and follow-up confirmatory tests applied for NBS of IEM.
