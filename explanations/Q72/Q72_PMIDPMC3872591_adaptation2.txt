What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

Newborn screening is important for the early detection of many hereditary and metabolic disorders. It is aimed at the earliest possible recognition and management of affected newborns, to prevent the health problems, deaths, and disabilities associated with an inherited metabolic disorder.
This comprehensive system includes; testing, education, follow up, diagnosis, treatment, management, and evaluation.
There are major differences among many of the disorders being considered for inclusion in newborn screening programs.
In recent times, advances in laboratory technology such as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), has increased the number of genetic conditions that can be diagnosed through newborn screening programs at birth.
With a single dried filter paper blood spot, MS/MS can identify more than 30 inherited metabolic disorders in around two to three minutes.
Advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders related to metabolism. Our understanding of the natural history of these disorders has also increased. Both these improvements have produced pressure to implement expanded newborn screening programs in many countries.
Even as many countries throughout the world have made newborn screening mandatory, in Iran, nationwide newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders has not been started, except for hypothyroidism. Because of this, there is not much information about these diseases.
This article aims to review the recent advances in newborn metabolic screening and its situation in Iran and other countries.
