What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM) are hereditary diseases that affect how the body processes nutrients. They vary both in how they appear in a patient and in they underlying genetic causes.
To date, more than 1000 different IEM have been identified.
Though each individual disease is rare, taken altogether the rate has been shown to be upwards of 1 in 800.
The way the diseases appear in patients can vary. This makes it difficult it diagnose them.
IEM are present in all ethnic groups and across every age.
Some IEM can be treated, with promising outcomes.
However, doctors suspecting these diseases from patient exams is not enough alone to reduce health problems and death.
In the last decade, expanded newborn screening has become a mandatory public health strategy in most developed and developing countries. This is due to the advent of a chemical detection technology called tandem mass spectrometry.
This technology allows more than 30 different metabolic disorders to be detected at low cost in one single blood spot specimen. The cost is about 10 dollars per baby, and the tests are highly accurate.

Studies of cost-effectiveness have confirmed that the savings from expanded newborn screening programs are much greater than the costs of running them.
The side effects of false positives (when the test is positive but the patient does not have the disease) are not significant in light of the economic and health benefits produced by expanded newborn screening. Further, these side effects could be lessened with more education, better communication, and improved technology.
Local screening agencies should be given the freedom to create their own screening programs so they can keep up with international advancements.
Improvements in knowledge of genes and how they affect the body are closely linked with expanded newborn screening.
This knowledge is growing because of advancements in nanotechnology (working with things at the microscopic level) and molecular genomics (the study of how changes DNA drive hereditary outcomes).
The potential of tandem mass spectrometry is extending to cover more disorders.
In fact, one promising example is the use of genetic markers for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that makes people extremely vulnerable to germs.
Newborn screening represents the highest volume of genetic testing.
It is more than a test and it calls for providing organized healthcare before, during, and after the test.
There should be a comprehensive reporting system requiring genetic counselling as well as short-term and long-term follow-up.
It is essential to integrate existing clinical IEM services with the expanded newborn screening program. This is to enable close communication between the laboratory, clinicians, and allied health parties.
In this article reviewing the topic, we will discuss the history of IEM, how it appears in children and adults, and its rate among different ethnicities. We will also discuss the history and recent expansion of newborn screening, its cost-effectiveness, associated pros and cons, and the ethical issues that can arise. Finally, we will discuss the technical aspects of tandem mass spectrometry and considerations for  interpreting results.
