What is newborn metabolic screening? what can the results tell doctors?

The aim of newborn screening is to identify healthy infants that will develop significant metabolic or endocrine disorders if left undiagnosed and untreated.
Newborn screening measures specific substances in various ways. Using the most sensitive screening tests can ultimately reduce or eliminate permanent consequences.
Specificity of a test distinguishes true negative results from false negative results (when the test is negative but the patient actually has the disease).
In general, this article discusses disorders that have treatments and that can be detected by routine and expanded newborn screening.
We give recommendations for testing by a general practice doctor, with confirmation by a metabolic or endocrine specialist.
We organize disorders in a table by the physical process they affect in the body or by the substance that is tested. In doing this we also pay attention to how the disease first appears, lab tests that can confirm the disorders, and treatments available.
There are many challenges for following up with patients, including diagnosis and appropriate understanding of the consequences of the disorders.
Meeting these challenges will require information. This can only be gained with large-scale studies that follow children identified by newborn screening over time to see their outcomes.
Newborn screening can only fully serve families once we have this knowledge.
