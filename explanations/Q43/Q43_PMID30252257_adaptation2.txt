How does pacemaker work?

Pacemakers are adjustable artificial electrical pulse generators commonly to aid heart rate, frequently emitting a pulse between 0.5 and 25 milliseconds with 0.1 to 15 volts, up to 300 times per minute.
The heart specialist or pacemaker technologist can assess and control the pacing rate, pulse width, voltage, and whether the device is temporary or permanent.
Pacemakers are usually categorized as external or internal.
The external type is almost always placed for temporary stabilization of the patient or to help some type of surgery.
The implantable type is usually permanent and often, more complex than the temporary, external type.
Pacemakers are one type of heart-related or cardiac implantable electronic devices (or CIED).
CIEDs also include implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which corrects irregular heart beats.
Together, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the transistor, which alters electrical signals.
As technology improved, so has the pacemaker.
The first implantable ICD was created in 1980. Since then, it has become more difficult to differentiate between pacemakers and ICDs.
This difficulty is because every ICD currently implanted aids against a slow heart rate.
It is important for the patient and clinician to know which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy.
This is likely to occur with any electromagnetic interference (EMI) and may activate the device (if it is an ICD).
Most types of CIEDs use many electrically-isolated lead wires with non-electrically-isolated tips impanted in the heart, either by skin vein insertion or directly by a heart surgeon.
Heart-related pacemakers are made of the pulse generator and the leads or electrical contact points.
