How does pacemaker work?

Pacemakers are electronics that stimulate the heart with electrical impulses to maintain or restore a normal heartbeat.
In 1952, Zoli described a means of supporting patients with internal heart-related pacemaker activity and/or conducting electricity across body parts by an artificial, electric, external pacemaker.
Below-skin electrodes (electrical contact points) maintained the heart's beat but only for a short period of time.
In 1957, complete heart block was done with electrodes directly attached to the heart.
These early observations led to the idea that heart-related electrical failure can be controlled.
It led to the creation of totally implantable pacemakers by Chardack, Gage, and Greatbatch.
Since then, there have been many advancements in pacemakers. The modern-day permanent pacemaker is placed below the skin.
There are 3 types of artificial pacemakers. One is implantable pulse generators with electrodes near the heart or muscle. Another is external, small, portable, battery-powered, pulse generators with external electrodes for temporary insertion near the heart or muscle for pacing. The final is battery- or circuit-powered devices for electric shocks or monitors with high-current external circuits for temporary insertion near the heart and muscle for temporary pacing in inconsistent scenarios, with manual or automatic initiation of pacing.
All heart-related pacemakers have a pulse generator, which gives an electrical impoulse for muscle or heart stimulation, and 1 or more electrodes or contact points to give the electrical impulse from the generator to target body part.
