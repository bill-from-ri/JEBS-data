How does pacemaker work?

The first heart-related or cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED), the electronic pacemaker, maintains heart-related contraction during a slow heart rate.
The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which corrects irregular heart beats, manages fast heart rate or irregular contractions and saves lives by high-energy shocks.
The heart-related or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device restores irregular heart pumps in patients with heart failure (HF).
Despite >50 years of pacing and 40 years of ICD therapy, the lead or contact point remains the weakest link between the device and patient.
