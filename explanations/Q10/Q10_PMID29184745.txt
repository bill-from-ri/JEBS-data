I have a cut on my arm and my fingers are sweating and i feel pain in my fingers. What can i do to stop the pain?

When patients present with acute or chronic hand and/or finger pain after an injury, try placing a pencil first over and then under the proximal phalanx of the finger that is generating the pain.
Ask the patient to flex and extend the fingers several times.
Putting the affected metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint more relatively flexed or extended than the other MP joints will often take away the pain with active movement with the pencil in place.
When this happens, our hand therapist builds a relative motion splint that simulates the effect of the pencil.
These are very functional splints that patients wear 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Most people can work with these splints on.
