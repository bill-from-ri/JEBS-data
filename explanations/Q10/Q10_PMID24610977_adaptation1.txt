I have a cut on my arm and my fingers are sweating and i feel pain in my fingers. What can i do to stop the pain?

To treat patients with chronic shoulder and low back pain, previous studies have successfully used a treatment called low level laser therapy (LLLT), a laser light used at a low level and applied to the skin of the body to reduce pain or inflammation and help heal wounds, tissues, and nerves.
The purpose of this current study is to find out if LLLT also helps patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.
This study included 9 male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain in the elbow, wrist, or fingers.

The tender point (specific area of pain) and three points surrounding the pain were exposed to the LLLT therapy light.
Each area was exposed two times for 20 seconds per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points.
Patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment with LLLT (laser therapy).
A tool called the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain by asking patients to report how intense their pain is on a scale.
The study analyzed VAS scores (how patients described their pain) after they received the LLLT laser treatment.
All VAS scores that document pain intensity were totaled and analyzed.
There was significant improvement in how much pain patients felt after they received the treatment.
The effect of the laser treatment lasted for about one and half days for patients with wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerve in the wrist).
In patients with other types of pain, the effect lasted for about 3-15 hours.
There was no change in how far patients could move or stretch the injured part of the body after the treatment.
This study found that low level laser therapy was helpful for chronic pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.
