Hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem involving hand pain, stiffness, practical limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life.
The objective is to measure the use of nighttime braces on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with typical osteoarthritis (OA) in the finger knuckles.


Fifty-two women with typical OA and bony lumps in the finger knucles were randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group.
The treatment group used a nighttime brace on the second or third finger of the dominant hand.
Both groups took part in an informational session.
Pain, grip and pinch strength, funciton, and manual performance were measured.
The treatment group showed a noticeable improvement in pain and hand function.
The improvement in pain paralleled functionality test scores and the loss of bony lumps in the third finger. They are predictors of the best recovery for treatment with a nighttime brace.
Nighttime braces are useful in reducing pain and improving hand function in women with hand osteoarthritis.
They are recommended for non-medication treatment of hand osteoarthritis.
Braces can be used, along with hand exercises and joint protection, to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand osteoarthritis.
This study can help occupational therapists, who help patients perform everyday activities, choose useful treatments for those with osteoarthritis.
