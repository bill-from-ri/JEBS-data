I have a cut on my arm and my fingers are sweating and i feel pain in my fingers. What can i do to stop the pain?

In previous studies, we used Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), therapy with applying light on the body's surface, in patients with non-specific, long-lasting pain of the shoulder joint and lower back.
This work measures the success of this specific light therapy for lasting joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.
Nine male and fifteen female patients with long-lasting joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers were treated at our hospital's recovery clinic from April, 2007 to March, 2009. These patients were employed in the study.



Patients visited the clinic twice a week and were checked after four weeks of treatment.
Pain was measured with a specific pain scale.


The average pain score noticeably improved after treatment.
The treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days regarding wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves pinched nerves in the wrist.
In other pain types, the treatment effect lasted for about three to fifteen hours.
No change in the range of motion was seen in any of the 24 patients.
LLLT at the settings used in this study was useful for long-lasting pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.
