How to dislodge meat from throat?

Achalasia describes a disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach.
People often have difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, spitting up undigested or partially digested food from the stomach, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss.
Measuring the strength and muscle coordination of your esophagus when you swallow led to the finding of 3 subtypes of achalasia that have different pressure and contraction patterns.
A lot of saliva and puckering where the esophagus is connected to the stomach, seen using a flexible tube with a camera, or a widened esophagus and narrowing where the esophagus is connected to the stomach, that looks like a bird's beak, found by X-raying the esophagus suggest achalasia.
In this guideline, we used a popular method to guide doctors on how best to diagnose and treat people with achalasia.
