How to dislodge meat from throat?

Most swallowing problems can be fixed, although the treatment depends on the type of trouble swallowing.
A team of surgeons, doctors who treat organs involved in speech production, and people who treat communication and swallowing disorders is needed to figure out the best treatment.
Information provided by the patient, examination of the swallowing muscles, and using a flexible tube with a camera to see swallowing of different foods help decide whether swallowing exercises are enough, or whether drugs or surgery are also needed to prevent something entering the airway or lungs by accident, prevent a lack of nutrients in the body, and prevent a lack of fluid in the body.
