How to dislodge meat from throat?

Objects that shouldn't be in the ear, nose, and throat are sometimes seen by family doctors, usually in children.
The most common objects are food, plastic toys, and small household items.
Diagnosis is often late because the event that caused the object to get stuck wasn't seen, the symptoms are vague, and people often are diagnosed incorrectly at first.
Most objects stuck in the ear and nose can be removed by a skilled doctor in the office with low risk of other problems.
Common methods to remove the object include the use of forceps, flushing with water, and using a long, flexible suction tube.
Objects stuck in the throat or windpipe are emergencies and considered for surgery.
X-rays are often normal.
Flexible or stiff tubes with cameras are usually needed to make sure the diagnosis is correct and to remove the object.
Doctors need to have a good reason to think there might be an object stuck in children with unexplained upper airway symptoms.
It is important to understand the bodyâ€™s structure and reasons to refer to a subspecialist.
The available information is not enough to make strong recommendations for specific ways to remove objects.
