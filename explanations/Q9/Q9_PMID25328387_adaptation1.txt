How to dislodge meat from throat?

We looked at the effects of rubbing an ointment with capsaicin, found in different types of hot peppers, on the ears to improve swallowing function and create a new and safe treatment for old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage.
We looked at 26 old people who had the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage.
We used a Q-tip to put ointment with 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) in the ear only once or once a day for 7 days before drinking 3 mL of colored water, which was recorded using a flexible tube with a camera and rated using a common test that measures how well one swallows.
After putting 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right ear, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing. This effect lasted for one hour.
After putting the ointment on alternating ears once a day for 7 days, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing in people with more serious sensations of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage.
Of the eight people fed with tubes in this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which then returned their ability to eat food by mouth.
We concluded that putting ointment with capsaicin on the ear improves swallowing function in old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage.
In the same way as other methods to stimulate the cough reflex, putting capsaicin on the ears may decrease how often people with difficulty swallowing develop pneumonia, caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident, through a cough reflex stimulated by a nerve.
