How to dislodge meat from throat?

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported.
Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging.
Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions.
Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson disease, or dementia.
Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration.
Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing.
This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders.
Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis.
Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed.
Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct.
Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken.
Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.
In these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered.
Speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.
