What does duloxetine do?

Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control.
Bladder control loss from stress is the most common type of urinary incontinence in women.
No approved drug therapy is available.
Chemical messengers, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, in the brain and spinal cord may control function of the bladder area.
A portion of the spinal cord receives chemical signals from serotonin and norepinephrine.
Drug studies show activity of serotonin and norepinephrine influences bladder area activity.
Duloxetine blocks removal of serotonin/norepinephrine and is studied for treating women with bladder control loss from stress.


In cats with impaired bladders, the drug improved bladder capacity and control proportionally with dosage.
In women with bladder control loss from stress, duloxetine reduced frequency of bladder control loss. 
In short, duloxetine increases bladder control and may help patients with bladder control loss from stress.
