What does duloxetine do?

This paper is about a patient with pain caused by diabetes who went to the doctor with very serious high blood pressure.
The patient's blood pressure was high after taking a 1-day dose of the antidepressant duloxetine (a drug that also treats diabetic nerve pain). The patient was diagnosed with a high blood pressure emergency.
The patient was given labetalol, a drug that lowers blood pressure.
The patient was switched to the drugs telmisartan and metoprolol, which treat high blood pressure.
This paper reports on a case of high blood pressure caused by the drug duloxetine. It was treated with drugs that treat high blood pressure and went back to normal after the patient stopped taking duloxetine.
