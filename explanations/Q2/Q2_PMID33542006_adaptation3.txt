What does duloxetine do?

A stiff jaw is a possible side effect of taking certain medications, such as antidepressant drugs or drugs called antipsychotics.
Here is an example of someone who visited the ER with a severely stiff jaw after taking the drug duloxetine.
The patient was a 40-year-old woman who was having trouble with opening her mouth and speaking five days after starting the drug duloxetine.

The woman's doctors found no other problems that might cause her jaw stiffness.
She was treated for muscle spasms with an IV and pills.
The woman improved right away and was told to stop taking duloxetine.
This is the first time the authors have heard of jaw stiffness being caused by the drug duloxetine.
Doctors should be aware of the risk of jaw stiffness since it could lead to very serious problems.
