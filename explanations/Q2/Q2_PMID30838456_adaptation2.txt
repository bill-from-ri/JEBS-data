What does duloxetine do?

This work covers antidepressants that block removal of the chemical messengers, serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE).
These antidepressants bind to 5-HT and NE transporters with varying effect.
Duloxetine, an antidepressant, is a stronger, more balanced drug for blocking the removal of 5-HT and NE.
Duloxetine suppresses the drug-metabolizing molecule, CYP2D6. Thus, careful dosage changes and monitoring are needed when used with other drugs digested by CYP2D6.
The most common side effects are nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, insomnia, physical weakness, and high blood pressure.
The drug works with similar success to other antidepressants.
Besides depression, duloxetine also treats nerve damage from diabetes and full-body muscle pain.
Similar medications that are used with another class of antidepressant medication can lead to high levels of serotonin.
