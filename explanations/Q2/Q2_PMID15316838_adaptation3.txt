What does duloxetine do?

Urinary incontinence is the inability to control your bladder.
Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common type of bladder control issue in women.
There are no drugs that are available to treat stress urinary incontinence.
Many studies have looked at two chemical messengers, serotonin and norepinephrine, for controlling bladder function.
The chemical messengers serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) go to one particular part of the spinal cord.
Drug studies find that drugs which help or block the chemical messengers 5HT and NE affect bladder control.
Duloxetine is a drug that increases the amount of 5HT and NE available for use and is being looked at to see if it can treat women with bladder control problems.
Duloxetine increases the amount of 5HT and NE available for use while not blocking the ability of the nerves to use the chemical messengers.
Duloxetine works for the treatment of bladder problems by increasing the amount of the chemical messengers 5HT and NE for use in one special area of the spinal cord
Researchers tested the drug in cats with irritated bladders and found that it improved bladder capacity and muscle control.
Duloxetine reduced bladder control problems for women in clincal trials.
To sum up, duloxetine may be a treatment option for bladder control problems because of its effect on the bladder and the results from clinical studies.
