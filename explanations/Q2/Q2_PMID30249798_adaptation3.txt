What does duloxetine do?

In addition to treating depression, antidepressants are used to treat chronic pain.
Doctors do not yet understand how exactly these drugs treat chronic pain.
This study combines the results of a study done on mice and a study done on humans to try to understand how the antidepressants work on pain.
The study shows two different ways that the drugs duloxetine and amitriptyline relieve nerve pain.
One way that duloxetine and amitriptyline work is by affecting the nerves quickly and strongly.
The other way duloxetine and amitriptyline work is by affecting the nerves in a delayed way using different chemical messengers.
The study suggests that duloxetine works by affecting the immune system around the nerve injury.
This means that certain treatments that affect the immune system also relieved pain caused by touch.
Researchers also found that duloxetine works similiarly in both humans and animals used for testing.
This study shows a delayed way that antidepressant drugs use to treat chronic pain.
In addition to treating depression, antidepressant drugs can also be used to treat chronic pain.
However, researchers still don't understand how antidepressant drugs work to treat chronic pain.
Previous animal studies did not give an answer to how antidepressants treat chronic pain.
This study shows that there are two different ways antidepressants treat chronic pain.
One way the antidepressants work is by affecting the brain and spinal cord quickly. The second way the antidepressants work is slower and affects the inmmune system around the nerves.
