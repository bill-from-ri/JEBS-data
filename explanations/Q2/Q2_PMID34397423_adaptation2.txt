What does duloxetine do?

Studies of antidepressants in minors with depression or anxiety have shown a higher risk of suicide attempts and other severe mental issues, such as aggression and agitation, when taking antidepressants.
Our objective was to see if healthy adolescents being treated for a non-mental condition also have a higher risk of suicide attempts and severe mental issues.
We took a second look at the results from a published trial of duloxetine (Cymbalta) for treating fibromyalgia (a chronic pain disorder). We used results both from the published article and from supplemental results online and from ClinicalTrials.gov.

We found that a significant portion of the adolescents on duloxetine had suicidal tendencies and other serious mental side effects. None of these problems were seen in the participants that weren't taking duloxetine.

We concluded that antidepressants may put adolescents at risk of suicidal tendencies and other serious mental problems, even if they are not being treated for depression or anxiety.
