What does duloxetine do?

Dry eye, depression, and treatent of depression may be linked.
This study investigates how different antidepressant drugs affects eye tears in patients with depression.
We included 132 patients using different antidepressants and 58 healthy people.
Different antidepressants were used by groups of size 34, 28, 36, and 34.
Participants filled out a questionnaire to measure depression.
We recorded different eye and tear measurements.
Participants completed an eye measurement test.
We also measured other parameters of the tear.
The depression group had smaller dry eye and tear volume than the healthy group.
The tear measurements of the antidepressant duloxetine group was lowest among the drug groups and notably different than the antidepressant venlafaxine group.
Dry eye of the depression group was worse than that of the healthy group.
We found that using antidepressants that block removal of the chemical messengers serotonin and noradrenaline affect the eye surface.
Besides blocking removal of serotonin, blockage of noradrenaline by these antidepressants may increase dry eye.
