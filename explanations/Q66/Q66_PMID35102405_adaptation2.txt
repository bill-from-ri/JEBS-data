Nephrotic syndrome what happens when gets bad?

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) includes a variety of underlying diseases that lead to serious proteinuria (too much protein in the blood) and edema (fluid buildup).
Minimal change disease (MCD) is still the most common cause of NS, and is the most responsive to treatment with drugs, often with little or no chronic kidney disease.
Other causes of NS include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which follows MCD, and secondary causes, including diseases outside the kidneys, infections, and drugs.
The initial diagnosis relies on signs and symptoms observed by a doctor. However, urine and blood tests, kidney tissue samples, and genetic testing are also important for diagnosis. This is especially true for NS not caused by MCD.
Additionally, signs of disease in blood and urine have become important areas for research in this disease.
The outcomes of NS and the way it progresses can vary and depend on the underlying disease. Corticosteroids are the main treatment.
Alternative treatments that have been found to work include calcineurin inhibitors (a class of drugs that suppress the immune system) and rituximab (Rituxan).
The course of the disease can range from continuing to come back, with or without serious kidney damage, to kidney failure in some cases.
Since the origin of NS is complicated and not completely understood, there are many associated problems. These include infections, electrolyte problems, serious kidney damage, and blood clots.
Pediatricians should know about how NS appears and the associated problems and long-term issues of NS and its treatment.
