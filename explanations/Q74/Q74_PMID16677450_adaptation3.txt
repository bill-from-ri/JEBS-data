Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Researchers studied the causes of chronic cough using specific rules for making the diagnosis.
A total of 194 patients with chronic cough for at least 3 weeks  and normal chest X-rays were included from an outpatient clinic in China.
The causes of chronic cough were studied using well established rules.
The diagnostic tests included: medical history, physical exam, lung function tests, sputum cell counts, esophagus acid test, CAT scan of sinuses or chest, and looking into the nose or lungs with the endoscope.
The final diagnosis of the cause of chronic cough was made based on all of these tests plus how patients responded to treatment.
The cause of chronic cough was found in about 95% of patients. About 83% had one cause, about 17% hadmore than one cause.
The 5 most important causes of cough were: eosinophilc bronchitis (inflammation of the airways), inflammation of the nose (rhinitis) and/or sinuses (sinusitis), cough variant asthma, allergic cough (atopic cough), and gastroesophageal reflux.
In this study in China, the types and amount of occurrences of the causes of chronic cough is different from studies done before in western countries.
Eosinophilic bronchitis and atopic cough are important causes of chronic cough.
Researchers changed the diagnostic rules for this reason.
