Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

A disorder caused by backflow of stomach contents into the back of the throat, nose, sinuses, and even the middle ear space is called laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).
The symptoms of LPR include: chronic cough, hoarseness, throat clearing, sore throat, feeling of a lump in throat, problems swallowing, postnasal drip, and bad breath.
In this study, two boys with chronic cough are discussed. One boy was thought to have asthma and given medicine for it. The other boy was found to have LPR by a test for acid in the throat.
Pediatricians should be able to recognize the symptoms of LPR.
The correct diagnosis and treatment results in improvement of the symptoms.
