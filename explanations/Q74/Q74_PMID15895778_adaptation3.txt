Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Chronic cough is often due to reflux, postnasal drip, or asthma.
We studied 28 patients with chronic cough or throat-clearing as a symptom of sensory neuropathy (nerve damage of nerves supplying sensation) to the throat and voice box (larynx). This sensory neuropathy involved the superior or recurrent laryngeal nerves.
These patients had sudden-onset cough, muscle spasm of the voice box (laryngospasm), or throat-clearing after viral illness, surgery, or due to an unknown reason.
Cough and laryngospasm were the most common complaints.
71% of the patients also had motor neuropathy (nerve damage to the nerves that control the muscles) of the throat. This damage was shown by special tests that measure the function of the larynx and vocal cords.
The patients were treated with the drug,  gabapentin (a drug used to treat seizures), if the workup did not show reflux, asthma, or postnasal drip.
Relief of the symptoms was achieved in 68% of these patients.
Sensory neuropathy of the throat and voice box should be considered in the workup for chronic cough or irritation of the larynx. 
If doctors suspect that cough and laryngospasm may due to a sensory neuropathy, use of antiseizure drugs such as gabapentin may help with these symptoms.
