Why do i have to constantly clear my throat and cough up flem?

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a complex of symptoms caused by the backflow of gastric contents into the larynx, pharynx, nasopharynx, sinuses and even to the middle ear space.
The symptomatology of LPR includes: chronic cough, hoarseness, throat clearing, laryngitis,"globus pharyngeus", swallowing disturbances, postnasal drip, "fetor ex ore".
In the article, the authors present two boys with chronic cough, in one of them the asthma was suspected and antiasthmatic treatment was administrated; in our patients according to the 24-hour pharyngeal pH-metry LPR was diagnosed.
The aim of this study was to emphasise that pediatricians should be able to recognise symptoms of LPR.
The appropriate diagnosis and treatment leads the symptoms to subside.
