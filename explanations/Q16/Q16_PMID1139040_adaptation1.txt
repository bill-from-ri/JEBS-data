How long to recover immune system from prednisone treatment?

Studies on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) that are taken from people and returned to the same individuals is performed on nine healthy volunteers to determine the effects of hydrocortisone (a steroid medication used to help calm the immune system) on the lymphocyte pools in blood.
The recirculating or re-added part of the new lymphocyte cells returned to volunteers quickly balanced with the  total lymphocyte pools and by 1 hour after the cells were put in the body, 21.8% were left in circulation.
Hydrocortisone is provided to the volunteers through the vein 24 hours after the infusion of cells. It caused a major but short-term lymphocytopenia (a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes in the blood) at 4 hours and then lymphocytes returned to normal levels by 24 hours after the injection.
Naturally occurring with lymphocytopenia was a big increase in lymphocyte (white blood cell) specific activity, while the total lymphocyte radioactivity (release of energy) in the circulation did not change, suggesting that corticosteroid administration reduced the recirculating cells that were not provided to the volunteers.
The lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) returned to normal after hydrocortisone use. The specific activity also returned to normal.
These studies suggest that giving hydrocortisone caused a short-term lymphocytopenia by reducing the recirculating portion of the lymphocyte pool in the blood.
