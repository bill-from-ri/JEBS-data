How long to recover immune system from prednisone treatment?

It is though that glucocorticosteroids (strong medicines that fight inflammation and work with the immune system) disrupt the elimination of immune complexes (build-up in the blood that can cause infection and problems with the immune system) by the mononuclear phagocyte system (a family of cells that fight foreign substances and are part of the immune system).
Researchers studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on how the mononuclear phagocyte system functions in 10 healthy volunteers using soluble (can be dissolved in water) build-up of human immunoglobulin G (an common antibody in the body that protects against infection) as a tool to monitor.
The mononuclear phagocyte system function is assessed before giving the steroid treatment and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone.
The elimination reaction and the use of the immunoglobulin by the liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment.
This suggests that high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, short-term effect on mononuclear phagocyte system functions.
