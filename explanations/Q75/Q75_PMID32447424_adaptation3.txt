What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) makes the severity of Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) better.
The major specific genetic areas effecting HbF levels are in the HBB cluster, BCL11A, and HMIP-2 (HBS1L-MYB) genes.
Researchers need to know more about how the areas of these genes effect the process of HbF levels and the outcome of disease in SCA.
Researchers analyzed the function and relationship of 14 mutations in 5 specific genetic areas of the genes with HbF levels and disease outcomes in 250 children with SCA in Southeastern Brazil.
They found single mutations that were linked to HbF levels in BCL11A and HMIP-2A and HMIP-2B genes.
Patients who had minor mutations (carriers) that increased HbF levels (HbF-boosting) had reduced white blood cells counts.
Carriers of other minor mutations (genetic differences) showed higher levels of oxygen in the blood.
Patients carrying still other minor genetic differences in BCL11A showed lower risk of transfusions.
These findings were separate from the HbF effect.
Carriers of other minor mutations showed lower risk of acute chest syndrome.
Carriers of the standard minor genetic change showed lower risk of infection.
Patients carrying HBF-boosting minor mutations of BCL11A and HMIP-2 genes had milder disease.
Higher HbF levels may be the cause of this effect.
