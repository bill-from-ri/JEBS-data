What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a disabling genetic blood disorder caused by a single mutation. SCD can have various outcomes,but it can result in severe pain crises, acute symptoms, and early death.
The severity of the problems that occur in SCD can vary depending on the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the blood.
High HbF levels are associated with decreased problems and death in patients with SCD.
Common single mutations in two genes, BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB, are thought to cause the changes in HbF levels seen in European populations without anemia.
Research has shown a connection between a single BCL11A gene mutation and HbF levels in some SCD patients.
In this paper, researchers found more single mutations in the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and HBC2 genes in two other groups of patients (a study in African Americans SCD patients and a study of SCD patients from Brazil).
We studied the effect of these single gene mutations on HbF levels and the number of pain crises in SCD.
We showed a strong connection between the single mutations in these genes and different HbF levels.
Common single mutations in the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, beta-globin (HBB) genes explain >20% of the different HbF levels in SCD patients.
These mutations, associated with HbF levels, are also associated with the number of pain crises in SCD patients.
This shows a clear example that inherited common gene mutations can change the severity of a genetic disease.
