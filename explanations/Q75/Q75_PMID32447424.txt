What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) ameliorates clinical severity of sickle cell anemia (SCA).
The major loci regulating HbF levels are HBB cluster, BCL11A, and HMIP-2 (HBS1L-MYB).
However, the impact of noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these loci on clinical outcomes and their functional role on regulating HbF levels should be better elucidated.
Therefore, we performed comprehensive association analyses of 14 noncoding SNPs in five loci with HbF levels and with clinical outcomes in a cohort of 250 children with SCA from Southeastern Brazil, and further performed functional annotation of these SNPs.
We found SNPs independently associated with HbF levels: rs4671393 in BCL11A (β-coefficient = 0.28), rs9399137 in HMIP-2A (β-coefficient = 0.16), and rs4895441 in HMIP-2B (β-coefficient = 0.15).
Patients carrying minor (HbF-boosting) alleles for rs1427407, rs93979137, rs4895441, rs9402686, and rs9494145 showed reduced count of reticulocytes (p < 0.01), while those carrying the T allele of rs9494145 showed lower white blood cell count (p = 0.002).
Carriers of the minor allele for rs9402686 showed higher peripheral saturation of oxygen (p = 0.002).
Patients carrying minor alleles in BCL11A showed lower risk of transfusion incidence rate ratio (IRR ≥ 1.3; p < 0.0001).
This effect was independent of HbF effect (p = 0.005).
Carriers of minor alleles for rs9399137 and rs9402686 showed lower risk of acute chest syndrome (IRR > 1.3; p ≤ 0.01).
Carriers of the reference allele for rs4671393 showed lower risk of infections (IRR = 1.16; p = 0.01).
In conclusion, patients carrying HbF-boosting alleles of BCL11A and HMIP-2 were associated with milder clinical phenotypes.
Higher HbF concentration may underlie this effect.
