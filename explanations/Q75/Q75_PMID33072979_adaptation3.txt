What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder due to a single mutation in the Beta-globin gene. This mutation causes a change in an amino acid in the Beta-hemoglobin protein that decreases the ability of oxygen to be carried out to the body.
Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) may experience a variety of signs, symptoms and disease outcomes from this disorder.
Understanding the causes, progression, and functional problems that result in patients with SCD are very important in finding and choosing treatments.
In this special paper, doctors discuss the importance of screening newborns for SCD. They also describe the genes, the pathology, and the signs and symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease.
This paper is the result of a very thorough research of the literature on SCD.
 The paper focuses on the pain SCD can cause after the decrease in fetal hemoglobin which occurs in infants as young as five to six months after birth.
The features seen in Sickle Cell Disease is probably due to a combination of the red blood cells being destroyed and the small blood vessels being blocked.
This paper also discusses new therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.
