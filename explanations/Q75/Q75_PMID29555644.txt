What is a gene affected by sickle cell anemia?

Sickle cell anemia (SCA), albeit monogenic, has heterogeneous phenotypic expression, mainly related to the level of hemoglobin F (HbF).
No large cohort studies have ever compared biological parameters in patients with major β-globin haplotypes; ie, Senegal (SEN), Benin (BEN), and Bantu/Central African Republic (CAR).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological impact of α genes, β haplotypes, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity at baseline and with hydroxyurea (HU).
Homozygous HbS patients from the Créteil pediatric cohort with available α-gene and β-haplotype data were included (n = 580; 301 females and 279 males) in this retrospective study.
Homozygous β-haplotype patients represented 74% of cases (37.4% CAR/CAR, 24.3% BEN/BEN, and 12.1% SEN/SEN).
HU was given to 168 cohort SCA children.
Hematological parameters were recorded when HbF was maximal, and changes (ΔHU-T0) were calculated.
At baseline, CAR-haplotype and α-gene numbers were independently and negatively correlated with Hb and positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase.
HbF was negatively correlated with CAR-haplotype numbers and positively with BEN- and SEN-haplotype numbers.
The BCL11A/rs1427407 "T" allele, which is favorable for HbF expression, was positively correlated with BEN- and negatively correlated with CAR-haplotype numbers.
With HU treatment, Δ and HbF values were positively correlated with the BEN-haplotype number.
BEN/BEN patients had higher HbF and Hb levels than CAR/CAR and SEN/SEN patients.
In conclusion, we show that BEN/BEN patients have the best response on HU and suggest that this could be related to the higher prevalence of the favorable BCL11A/rs1427407/T/allele for HbF expression in these patients.
