How can asthma be prevented?

The National Disease Management Program (NDM Program) represents the basic content of healthcare involving different types of care.
The NDM Program coordinates different fields and areas of healthcare.
Recommendations are developed through agreement from scientific medical organizations using the best available evidence.
The scientific medical organizations that focus on the prevention, diagnosis, therapy, and rehabilitation of asthma agreed on a National Disease Management Guideline for Asthma in 2005.
The group agrees that breastfeeding and non-smoking are suggested as a primary prevention measure (preventing disease before it occurs) for expecting parents.
Recommendations are made for secondary prevention (identifying disease at an early stage before symptoms start) to avoid allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction), smoking or secondhand smoke, and immunotherapy (the treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system).
Statements on vaccination and specific immunotherapy are developed for tertiary prevention (slowing or stopping disease that is affecting a patient).
This paper presents both the original texts of the recommendations and the evidence supporting the recommendations.
