How can asthma be prevented?

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, asthma became very widespread.
Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways.
There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, temperature) may shape asthma's development.
Researchers reviewed multiple environmental, biologic (such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels) and sociologic (such as education and socioeconomic) factors that may be important in the development of asthma.
Other studies show that multiple steps and actions are required to prevent asthma.
Studies that focus on reducing or avoiding allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) are beneficial.
Asthma represents an error in how our genes and the environment interact, especially during pregnancy and early infant life.
The increase in the number of asthma cases may also signal an increased risk in the general population for the development of other chronic autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks healthy cells.
This review of studies focuses on the factors that may be important in the early prevention of asthma before it starts to develop.
A better understanding of gene-environment interactions and how they are involved in the development of asthma will help create interventions and treatment programs for individuals in order to prevent asthma.
