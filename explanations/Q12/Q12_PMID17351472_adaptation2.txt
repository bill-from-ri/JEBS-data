How can asthma be prevented?

The prevalence of asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) is increasing globally, especially in developed countries.
This article focuses on the literature of asthma prevention in childhood.
Many early experiences with the environment are linked with reduced widespreadness of asthma, but the reasons are unknown.
Recent studies show little success in preventing asthma or its effects with asthma medications, once therapy ends.
Immunotherapy, treatment of disease by altering immune system activity, is another treatment for preventing asthma. Groups treated with immunotherapy show fewer allergy developments and asthma.
Many multi-treatment trials show reduced intensity of the effects of asthma but not changes in measures like lung function or sensitivity between treatment groups.
The most promising prevention treatments of asthma have used multi-treatment strategies with both diet and environmental changes.
We need more evidence to measure the effects of multi-treatment trials and new strategies for asthma prevention in childhood.
