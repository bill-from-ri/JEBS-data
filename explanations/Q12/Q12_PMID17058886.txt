How can asthma be prevented?

The National Disease Management Program (NDM Program) represents the basic content of structured, cross-sectoral healthcare.
In particular, the NDM Program is directed towards coordinating different disciplines and areas of healthcare.
The recommendations are developed through interdisciplinary consensus of the scientific medical societies on the basis of the best available evidence.
Within this scope the scientific medical societies concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, therapy and rehabilitation of asthma consented upon a National Disease Management Guideline for Asthma in 2005.
Among other things, the following cornerstones of asthma prevention were agreed upon: Breastfeeding and non-smoking were suggested as primary prevention measures for (expectant) parents.
With respect to secondary prevention, recommendations have been made for allergen avoidance, active/passive smoking and immunotherapy.
Regarding tertiary prevention, position statements on vaccination and specific immunotherapy are developed.
The present paper presents both the original texts of the recommendations and the evidence underlying them.
