How can asthma be prevented?

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is an increase in sensitivity to different things that cause the airway to narrow. When BHR is the main cause of developing asthma, BHR may be adjusted by internal and external factors as well as by climate and meterologic (atmosphere, humidity, wind, temperature) factors.
Inflammation that can make the disease worse, combined with changes in the mucus of airways, brings on or increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
Viral infections in the upper airway (the nose, nasal cavity, and pharynx or throat area), exposure to allergens in people with tendencies to have an allergy, long-lasting hyperplastic changes (extra cell growth) of the upper airways, irritants (substances that cause discomfort) and pain drugs in the airways are seen as the most likely asthma triggers in vulnerable children and adults.
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) may be improved with steroid (man-made drugs with a synthetic hormone) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that relieve pain) and with maritime climatotherapy, where a patient is relocated to a different location close to the sea for health reasons.
Maritime climatotherapy may improve BHR by reducing the level of irritants inhaled from the air.
How maritime climatic cures work are discussed.
Metereological (weather) events such as cold weather fronts have shown a negative impact on how asthma disease progresses.
An improvement of BHR is observed at the end of climatotherapy using the histamine challenge test, which tests how sensitive airways are to irritants.
Future studies on asthma prevention in patients at risk with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy (allergies) should evaluate the effects and importance of maritime climatotherapy.
