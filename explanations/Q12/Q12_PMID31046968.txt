How can asthma be prevented?

Several risk factors for asthma have been linked with exposures during pregnancy, making their true effects similarly hard to elucidate given the constraints of conducting research in this particular group, and the difficulty of interpreting any findings.
A report published in Pediatrics outlined the effects of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of atopic disease (including asthma) in children, reflecting that multiple factors could act in concert to influence disease development.
Maternal exposure to vitamin D has been investigated as a risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze, with conflicting findings; several studies have reported that vitamin D could protect against asthma attacks or prevent worsening asthma symptoms.
Many studies have investigated such associations with risk of disease, but the reporting in the media of the study findings often leaves much to be desired in terms of nuance and balance.
