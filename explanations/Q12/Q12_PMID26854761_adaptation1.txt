How can asthma be prevented?

This article describes the relationship between early-life respiratory infections (infections in the lungs that impact breathing and occur in the first few years of life) and how asthma begins. The article also discusses new strategies to prevent asthma by stopping these infections.
Viruses that occur in early life, especially respiratory syncytial virus (a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes) and human rhinovirus (the common cold), usually occur before asthma starts.
These viruses may have different roles in how asthma develops.
How airway microbiome (micro-organisms such as bacteria in the lungs) interact with bacteria from viruses may determine that a child will develop asthma.
New strategies for preventing these infections that occur early in life, or for weakening the symptoms of infections, are being investigated and may help prevent childhood asthma.
In summary, early-life infections are major factors of asthma development.
How these early-life infections lead to asthma is from the reactions between the virus, genes, and the environment.
New treatment and therapy strategies that target these infections have been researched, and more studies are needed to see if they will help prevent asthma.
