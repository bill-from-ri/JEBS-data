How can asthma be prevented?

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes and can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (infection in the airways). These infections are a common reason for infant hospital stays, long-term lung problems, and the development of asthma, a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe.
Many neutrophils (white blood cells that fight infection) enter the airways of children with bronchiolitis (a common lung infection in children and infants) caused by RSV.
However, why neutrophils are sent to the site of lung infection is not clear.
This review discusses how neutrophils help the immune system respond to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections.
Neutrophils can limit how the virus spreads and can activate the immune system to fight the virus.
Sometimes neutrophils that are fighting infection can lead to tissue damage.
Neutrophils that cause injury to airways when an infant's lungs are being developed have a long-term impact on lung function and may lead to asthma.
Medications that can change neutrophils may be explored as a possible therapy for bronchiolitis caused by RSV and prevent the development of asthma.
For patients with bronchiolitis caused by RSV, it is best to use a general antiviral medication when also using neutrophils to help fight infection.
