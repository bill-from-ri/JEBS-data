How to treat phda1?

This study focuses on the ability of self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors (a gene therapy tool that introduces genetic material using a modified virus to create a normal copy of a damaged gene) to deliver the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene called PDHA1 (a gene involved in the chemical process to create energy for the body) and create proteins. Cell samples of connective tissue from 3 patients with mutations in PDHA1 and 3 healthy patients were collected for the gene therapy process.
Cells are given genetic material with scAAV vectors containing a gene that creates proteins.

Two types of vectors, the scAAV2 and scAAv6, were found to be the most effective way to deliver the genetic material into cells.

Both vectors increase the production of gene proteins in patients with the damaged genes and in patients with healthy cells.
Dichloroacetate, a drug used to treat genetic mitochondrial diseases (diseases where the miochondria cannot create enough energy for cells), is also used to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, (an enzyme used in metabolism to create energy).

The use of dichloroacetate did increase productivity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in cells with damaged genes involved in metabolism.
Dichloroacetate did increase production of proteins from certain energy-related genes and activity in other parts of pyruvate dehydrogenase (a protein involved in the chemical process that creates energy for the body).
This study shows that a combination of gene therapy and drugs may be a promising treatment for people with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency or shortage.
