How to treat phda1?

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) or shortage is a rare disorder that can impact metabolism and lead to problems in the brain and nerves.
Structural brain abnormalities are common in PDCD.
A case of a patient with PDCD is described.
A 20-month-old boy with hypotonia (low muscle tone) and developmental delay, was seen by doctors and also had hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in tissues) and trouble breathing due to bronchiolitis (a lung infection).
While in the hospital, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds, a child formula or nutritional food product.
Two days after starting these feeds, he stopped breathing and needed a tube inserted in his throat to help him breathe.

After being stable and fasting (no food or drinks), feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis (lactic acid build up that can cause nausea, vomiting, and breathing problem).

The MRI (scanned image) of the brain was normal.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) was confirmed by viewing the muscle tissue under a microscope.
The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in one of the genes called PDHA1 (a gene that encodes a building block of PCD).
The seriousness of PDCD can range from infant death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in the child case described here.
A normal brain MRI is reported in only 2% of patients with PDCD.
There is no effective treatment for PDCD.
In patients with muscle weakness and who are unable to eat foods with glucose, the presence of lactic acidosis should raise the suspicion of PDCD regardless of the patient's age and normal MRI.
