How to treat phda1?

Diets low in carbohydrates and proteins but high in fat stimulate the liver to make fat-related energy molecules called ketone bodies (KB).
Ketone bodies are molecules used as alternate fuel to produce energy for tissues in the body.
Making and using ketone bodies is carefully controlled within the body at the molecule and hormone level.
One hormone, known as the master regulator of the process to develop ketone bodies, helps activate the cell networks that control fatty acids and ketogenesis, the process that creates ketone bodies.
New factors, such as circadian rhythms (the natural cycle of mental and physical changes in the body over 24 hours) and paracrine signals (cell signaling to communicate with other cells nearby), are becoming important aspects of this metabolic regulation that controls and monitors cell energy stores.
However, ketone bodies are currently considered not only as an energy supply but also as signaling molecules that send messages to other cells or parts of the body.

Ketogenic diets are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy (the onset of seizures in infancy), which is also caused by genetic defects.
However, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use ketogenic diets in other diseases, such as cancer, brain-related and metabolic disorders.
Nonetheless, clear-cut evidence of the performance of ketogenic bodies in other disorders is needed in order to suggest using such diets.
