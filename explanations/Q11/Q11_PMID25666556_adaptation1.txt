Mitochondria are the parts of cells that produce energy for the body.
Ketone bodies are particles made from breaking down fats and can serve as an alternative to generate energy.
The ketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrates, forces the body to use fat as its main source of energy.
The ketogenic diet is used to help drug resistant epilepsy (seizures that cannot be conrolled with medicine) and for rare diseases that impact metabolism and the process for changing sugar into energy.
There is increasing evidence that the ketogenic diet may also be helpful as an additional therapy for cancer.
