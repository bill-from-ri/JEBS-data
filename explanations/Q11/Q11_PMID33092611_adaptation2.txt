How to treat phda1?

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) quickens the permanent conversion of pyruvate (a particle used for energy-production) into acetyl-CoA (another particle used for energy production).
PDC shortage can occur from changes in genes involved in creating its components.
The resulting physical traits, though very different, mainly affect the brain and spinal cord.
This study explores the medical, biochemical and gene-related information from thirteen PDC scarce patients. The study seeks to create possible gene-physical trait connections.

The data agrees with earlier reports describing a specfic gene's sequence changes as the main cause of PDC shortage. However, the results also reveal a large presence of another gene's sequence changes among Portuguese patients. Most carry a possibly private gene sequence change.

Regarding medical characteristics, all patients show coordination setback, the intensity of which seems to parallel the type and location of the patient's gene sequence change.
Treatment options include administration of a low-carb diet and thiamine, although arginine aspartate may also help.

Identifying disease-causing gene sequence changes, along with the altered cellular substances, help explain the physical traits caused by the disease and select the best treatment.
