How to treat phda1?

Diets low in carbs and proteins and high in fat quicken the creation of liver ketone bodies (KB) (particles made from fat breakdown).
KB are used for energy creation in certain body parts.
The creation and use of KB from fat breakdown are monitored both at the cellular and multi-cellular level.
The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) is a major regulator of the creation of KB made from fat breakdown. It combines diet signals to the start up of cellular systems monitoring fat breakdown and KB creation.
New factors, like sleep-wake patterns and cellular signals, may strongly influence this metabolic monitoring.
However, KB are not just energy particles but also signaling particles.
β-hydroxybutyrate (a particle made from fat breakdown) blocks some cellular processes. This creates a connection between products of liver fat breakdown and changes in gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence.
Ketogenic diets (KD) or low-carb diets are used to treat different forms of infatile epilepsy, a disorder in babies that disturbs brain and nerve activity and causes seizures. Infantile epilepsy is also caused by flaws in gene expression.
However, researchers are now focusing on using KD in other diseases, such as cancer, nerve-related and metabolic disorders.
More evidence is needed to use KD diets to treat diseases.
