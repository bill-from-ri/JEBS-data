What is islet cell antibody group?

Measurement of cells that make insulin is an important indicator of diabetes development in people at risk for diabetes.
Although the disease most often happens before 17 years of age, normal values for insulin release were not available for this age group.
We did an I.V. (injected) glucose tolerance test in 167 normal children, and in 98 islet cell antibody (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells)-negative (without ICA) and 12 ICA-positive (with ICA) siblings of diabetic patients.
The children ranged from 1-16 years of age.
The first part of insulin release, measured as the total blood insulin levels at 1 and 3 minutes, increased with age and was significantly lower in ICA-negative siblings than in normal children.
We did not see a difference in the first part of insulin release before 8 years of age.
None of the ICA-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 years.
The first part of insulin response was similar in ICA-positive and ICA-negative siblings, but significantly lower than in normal children.
We do not know the reason ICF-negative siblings had lower insulin release, but it could have to do with insulin-producing cells growing incorrectly or insulin release that could be part of the complicated development of type 1 diabetes.
