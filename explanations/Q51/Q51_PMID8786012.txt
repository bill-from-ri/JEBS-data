What is islet cell antibody group?

We studied the effect of severe reduction of beta-cell mass by 90% pancreatectomy on the immune tolerance to the endocrine pancreas.
Four months after subtotal pancreatectomy all LEW.Han rats had developed mononuclear infiltration of islets and 9 of 14 rats were positive for islet-cell antibodies.
Electron microscopy revealed lymphocytic invasion of endocrine tissue, lysis of beta cells and phagocytotic macrophages.
None of these changes were seen 2 weeks after 90% pancreatectomy or 4 months after 10% pancreatectomy.
Weekly substitution of islet antigens in the form of a homogenate of 100 islets into 90% pancreatectomized LEW.Han rats almost completely prevented the development of insulitis and autoantibodies.
The dependence of insulitis on T cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in LEW.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration.
The exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups.
During the observation period insulitis was not associated with overt diabetes but was accompanied by substantial enlargement of islets and of beta-cell mass, as shown by morphometry.
Suppression of islet inflammation by injection of islet antigens abolished beta-cell regeneration, despite continuing metabolic stress in rats with 90% pancreatectomy.
The findings indicate induction of islet autoimmunity in response to 90% but not to 10% pancreatectomy.
We conclude that severe reduction of the islet-antigen mass allows the development of T-cell-dependent islet autoimmunity which indicates a loss of immune tolerance.
In addition, the data suggest the existence of islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells in rats not genetically predisposed to autoimmune diabetes.
Finally, we conclude that selective beta-cell regeneration occurs in association with insulitis.
