What is islet cell antibody group?

Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are an indicator of type 1 diabetes.
ICA are found in 60-80% of patients with type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear.
Type 2 diabetics with ICA are likely to develop type 1 diabetes.
The current way to measure ICA is not always reliable.
A reliable standardized test could use pancreas tissue, tissue from an organ that monitors blood sugar levels.
A standardized test to measure ICA is under way.
Scientists have recently developed a standardized test to measure anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, a rare protein.
Anti-GAD antibodies and ICA have similar meanings.
The standardized test to measure anti-GAD can be repeated and is easy to do, so it should be used widely at the same time as the test to measure ICA.
