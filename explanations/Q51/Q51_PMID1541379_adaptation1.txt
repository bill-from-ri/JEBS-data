What is islet cell antibody group?

We compared background insulin release in nine islet-cell antibody (protein made against insulin-producing cells) positive, non-diabetic parents or siblings of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and nine normal people matched for age, sex and weight.
Short-term insulin responses to an I.V. (injected) glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups.
We measured blood insulin in people who had not had anything to eat for a period of time in blood samples taken every minute for 2 hours.
We looked at blood insulin over time to see how it rises and falls.
The islet-cell antibody-positive group (group with the antibody) did not have a regular pattern, but normal people had a 13-minute cycle.
The islet-cell antibody-positive group did have a peak every 13 minutes.
We conclude that the overall rise and fall of background insulin release is changed in islet-cell antibody positive people even when the short-term insulin response is normal.
