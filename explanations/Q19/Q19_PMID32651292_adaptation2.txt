Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

We tested if there are 2 different types of Parkinson tremors, or body shakes due to a brain-related disease affecting movement, based on individualized responses to medication altering levels of dopamine, a chemical messenger.
We checked if these patterns are tremor-specific by comparing individualized responses of dopamine by tremors to those by bradykinesia (a slowing of movement).
We tested responsiveness to levodopa (a Parkinson's medication) in 76 patients with Parkinson tremors, or shakes by a brain-related disease affecting movement.




In 41 patients, a dopamine-sensitivty test was repeated after around 6 months.
The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, was atypical.
There were 3 types of tremor dopamine-responsiveness: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor.
A levodopa sensitivity test 6 months later matched these tremor response categories.
Patients with dopamine-responsive tremors had higher disease severity and frequency of impaired movement.
Parkinson resting tremors has 3 physical trait types, based on dopamine response.
These tremor patterns may be linked with unrevealed biological processes and need different treatments.
