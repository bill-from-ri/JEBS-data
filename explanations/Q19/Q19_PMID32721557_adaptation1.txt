Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

Parkinson's disease, the second most frequent brain disorder that impacts movement and coordination, is linked to increased central (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral (nerves) inflammation (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection).
Although the response of the immune system to dopamine drugs is not fully understood, dopaminergic agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine) are known to show immune system-regulating characteristics which may, at least in part, explain their effect in Parkinson's disease.
There is a need to analyze immune characteristics in long-term studies on Parkinson's disease patients who are receiving specific drugs.
In this study, patients with Parkinson's disease are included in a two-year prospective study (a study that takes a set number of subjects and follows them over a long period). This study compares the effect of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) alone and a combination of levodopa and pramipexole (dopamine-promoting) drugs on several regulating and pro-inflammatory (capable of causing inflammation) immune cells in the body.
Researchers demonstrate that patients with Parkinson's disease show decreased levels of important cells that regulate the immune system.
In particular, when given alone, levodopa decreases the levels of functional Bregs (a type of regulating immune cell) and SLAMF1+ tolerogenic DCs (immune receptors and cells that direct and regulate the immune response) and increases the levels of total and HLA DR+classical monocytes (molecules that produce antigens and fight inflammation). The combination of levodopa and pramipexole drugs may promote Treg- and tolerogenic DC responses (cells that regulate responses and may suppress immune response).
These results suggest that treatment plans based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory type of response in patients with Parkinson's disease, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically helpful regulatory-type environment.
