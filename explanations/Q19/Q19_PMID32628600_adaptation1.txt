Does prescribing dopamine in the early stages of parkinsonâ€™s disease help patients?

A major advancement has been made in the treatment related to central nervous system disorders (disorders impacting the brain and spinal cord), especially Parkinson's disease.
New medications and more information on how they change proteins in the body lead to new interest in many promising therapies for Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease is defined by neuronal degeneration (the loss of nerve cells in the brain) and neuroinflammation (inflammatory response within the brain or spinal cord due to the immune system responding to injury or infection). The presence of the neurofibrillary aggregates (accumulation of a protein inside neurons) is considered as the trait to help diagnose.
Additionally, it is also characterized by the presence of motor (movement) and non-motor (unrelated to movement such as pain and tiredness) symptoms, as seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.
Many treatment options mainly focus on prevention measures or on treating the symptoms of Parkinson's.
Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the areas of interest to focus on in Parkinson's disease.
A thorough study of these areas helps address changing molecules that cause the neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease.
Many drugs are available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, although levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) is the preferred drug because it controls symptoms. However, it also has side effects.
It is always suggested to use other drug therapies with levodopa.
A number of major causes and therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease have been identified in the last 10 years. This text highlights the most significant of them.
It is also found that structured treatment plans and therapies depend on the individual and should be made specifically for the individual patient's needs.
