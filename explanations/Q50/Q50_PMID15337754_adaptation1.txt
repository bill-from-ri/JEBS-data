What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that has remained relatively unchanged from evolution. CRP has similar forms in vertebrates and many invertebrates and participates in the systemic (full-body) response to inflammation (infection-fighting).
Its plasma (blood) concentration increases during inflammation. This is a characteristic that has long been employed for clinical purposes.
CRP is a pattern recognition molecule. This means CRP binds to specific molecular configurations typically found during cell death or on the surfaces of pathogens (foreign organisms).
The rapid increase in CRP production within hours after tissue injury or infection suggests that it contributes to host defense. This also indicates that CRP is part of the innate immune response.
Recently, an association between minor CRP elevation and future major heart-related events has been recognized. This has lead to government health agencies recommending that patients at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease (damage in the heart's major blood vessels) might benefit from measurement of CRP.
This review focuses on the current understanding of the structure of CRP, the molecules it binds and interacts with, and its functions.
