What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

Background: There is no agreeing if rescue therapy can avoid short-term colectomy in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.
Aims: The aim of our study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included.
Response to therapy was defined as three or more point reductions in Mayo score after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year.
The predictors analysed were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score.
Results: Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score (P = 0.04).
Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab (P = 0.03).
In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with C-reactive protein >3 mg/L had a response rate significantly higher than those with C-reactive protein <3 mg/L (P = 0.03); those with negative C-reactive protein and moderate Mayo score did not responded to therapy, while in the ones with elevated C-reactive protein and/or severe Mayo score, 15 versus 4 responded (P = 0.008).
Conclusions: Our data suggest that cyclosporine A is advisable in ex-smokers.
In never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of Mayo score â‰¤10 and/or negative CRP, while cyclosporine A is indicated in case of Mayo score >10 and positive CRP.
