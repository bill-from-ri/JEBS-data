What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

The role of subclinical intrauterine infection in preterm labor was evaluated prospectively in 40 patients and appropriate control subjects.
The 24 preterm labor patients (60%) with a negative C-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis 95.8% of the time, with a mean delay of delivery of 35.5 days and a mean gestational age of 36.9 weeks.
The 16 patients (40%) with a positive C-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis only 37.5% of the time, with a mean delay of delivery of 14.4 days and a mean gestational age of 33.2 weeks.
Pathologic evidence of chorioamnionitis was present in 32.9% of 310 preterm deliveries as compared to only 22.3% of 1631 term deliveries.
The presence of subclinical infection must be considered in cases of preterm labor, especially among patients for whom tocolytic therapy is unsuccessful.
