What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

We evaluated the impact of tumor shrinkage (TS) induced by molecular targeted therapy as the first-line systemic therapy on the survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
A total of 67 patients with mRCC who received first-line molecular targeted therapy were included in this study.
Sixty patients were evaluable by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors.
Patients underwent the first evaluation at 8-12 weeks after the start of the therapy.
Twenty patients had TS ≧30%, 32 from 30% to -20%, and 8 ≦-20%.
The median overall survival periods of patients who achieved TS ≧30%, from 30% to -20%, and ≦-20% at first evaluation were 41.0, 35.0, and 11.5 months, respectively.
Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TS of≧0%, in addition to negative C-reactive protein and the absence of bone metastasis were good predictors of overall survival.
The patients who achieved 0% or more at the initial evaluation had longer survival than those who had no tumor reduction (40.0 months vs 12.0 months, p<0. 001).
These findings suggest that early TS affects overall survival in real practice.
We should consider alternative therapies for patients who have not achieved tumor reduction at the initial evaluation.
