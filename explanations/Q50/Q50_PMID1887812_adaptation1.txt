What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

Sarcoidosis is a disease that is characterized by granuloma formation or the tiny growth collections of inflammation (infection-fighting) cells. One of these cell types is the immune cell, macrophage. Macrophages are one of the most important building blocks of this disease.
Macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (II-1), a protein that helps fight infections.
Interleukin-1 has many functions, including the stimulation of the hepatic (liver) production of C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
Serum (blood) C-reactive protein was measured in 48 patients. Seventeen of the patients had active sarcoidosis in the lung. Ten patients had other lung diseases of unknown origin. Eleven patients had active lung tuberculosis (a serious lung infection). Ten patients were healthy volunteers.
Serum C-reactive protein was measured.
The serum C-reactive protein was negative (no detection) in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four.
Patients with other lung diseases had negative results in 7 cases and positive (was detected) in 3 cases.
The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases.
All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements.
The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared. There was also a significant difference between the group of other lung diseases and tuberculosis.
Levels of serum C-reactive protein are valuable in the identification of sarcoidosis and other lung diseases of unknown origin from tuberculosis and other diseases.
