What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

The aim of this paper was to determine how C-reactive protein volume in patients can help diagnose bacterial infections in children. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting).
The study evaluated 11 children. The group consisted of six boys and five girls that were between 3 months to 3 years of age. All of the children's' initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection.
C-reactive protein was measured at the first medical examination.
The eleven children were diagnosed with various illnesses. These include: 4 with urinary tract infection, 2 with bacterial meningitis (inflammation with intense headaches), 2 with sepsis (life-threatening condition when the body's response to infection damages itself), 2 with pneumonia (lung infection) and 1 with arthritis of the hip joint.
CRP levels were increased during the course of infection.
The cause of the bacterial infections were not specified.
Eight patients were examined within 12 h of illness. Three showed negative CRP values despite the duration of the illness over 12 h.
Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection. The other five were not.
Each patient was treated. Treatment led to better health status without any serious complications.
Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children.
The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset.
The data suggest that doctors of children should always be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative (no detection) and that serial (multiple) CRP measurements appear to be practical.
