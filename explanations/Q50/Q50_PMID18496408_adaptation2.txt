What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

The study's objective is to compare the accuracy of procalcitonin (a prototype molecule for a calcium-regulating molecule) and C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation) as markers of bacterial infection in very ill children at the start of full-body or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), an exaggerated immune response to a harmful stressor.

The study takes place at a university-partnered child-care unit.
Patients include those with SIRS.
Treatment was that from June to December 2002, all hospital patients were tested daily to include cases of SIRS.
At inclusion (start of SIRS), we measured procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and some cell types.
Identification of bacterial infection was made based on facts and judgment of experts unaware of the procalcitonin and C-reactive protein measures.
Starting and daily data on illness severity, organ dysfunction, and health outcome were collected.
Sixty-four patients were included in the study and divided into either bacterial SIRS group, with 25 patients, or nonbacterial SIRS group, with 39 patients.
Procalcitonin levels were higher in patients with bacterial infection than those without.
Accuracy was higher for procalcitonin than for C-reactive protein.
Detecting high procalcitonin, when added to bedside clinical judgment, increased the chance of bacterial infection from 39% to 92%. Not detecting C-reactive protein decreased the chance of bacterial infection from 39% to 2%.
Procalcitonin is better than C-reactive protein for detecting bacterial from nonbacterial SIRS in very ill children, although the accuracy of both tests is moderate.
Detection accuracy could be enhanced by combining the tests with bedside clinical judgment.
