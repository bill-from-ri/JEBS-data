What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

We analyzed the short-term and long-term outcome of 42 patients with distal type aortic dissection.
Twenty-eight patients underwent intensive medical therapy within two weeks after the onset of pain (acute dissection).
The remaining 14 patients had chronic dissection.
The goals of medical treatment were to control blood pressure and to attain a negative C-reactive protein test result.
Hospital survival rate in the patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28).
In-hospital complications included changes in mental status, renal dysfunction, bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and liver dysfunction, all of which were managed medically.
Three of these patients underwent surgical therapy in the chronic phase and were discharged uneventfully.
Fifteen (62.5%) of the 24 medically treated patients were discharged with negative C-reactive protein tests.
Spontaneous resolution of a dissection was demonstrated by radiological examinations in 8 cases.
Five-year survival rates in 24 medically treated patients was 93%.
Hospital survival rate in the patients with chronic dissection was 100% (14/14).
The rigorous control of blood pressure in the acute phase, and subsequent meticulous evaluation of the dissection by radiological tests and C-reactive protein test provides acceptable short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with acute distal dissection without the need for emergency surgical intervention.
