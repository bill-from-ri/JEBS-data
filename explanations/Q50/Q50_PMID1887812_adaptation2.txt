What does a negative result of a c-reactive protein test indicate?

Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by growths of inflammatory cells in the body.
The activated macrophage, a specialized white blood cell defender against invaders, in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (Il-1), a molecule which signals inflammation.
Interleukin-1, among other functions, activates the liver production of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.
We measured the blood C-reactive protein in 17 patients with active lung-related sarcoidosis, 10 with other long-lasting lung diseases of unknown cause, 11 with active lung tuberculosis (a bacterial lung infection), and 10 healthy volunteers.
Blood C-reactive protein was measured with a specific lab test.
The blood C-reactive protein was not detected in 13 patients with active sacroidosis and was detected in four.
C-reactive protein was not detected in 7 patients with other lung diseases and was detected in 3 cases.
The tests of C-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis-related mucus was detected in 10 cases.
No C-reactive protein was detected in healthy patients.
There was a difference between groups when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis blood C-reactive protein measurements were compared, along with a difference between the group of other lung diseases and tuberculosis.
Measuring blood C-reactive protein is valuable to differentiate sacroidosis and other lung-lasting lung diseases of unknown causes from tuberculosis and other diseases known to cause an immediate response.
