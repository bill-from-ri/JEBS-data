Extra fingers or toes are relatively common in newborns. 
It can be a sign of different problems with the nervous and other systems. 
Doctors need to know about the conditions that cause extra fingers and toes. 
Pallister-Hall syndrome is a rare condition associated with having extra fingers and toes. 
A 10-month-old male child had a small head, unusually prominent forehead, increased distance between the eyes, flat nose, a shorter than normal distance between the upper lip and the nose, incomplete cleft (slit) in the upper lip and the roof of the mouth, extra fingers, and fused fingers.
The child vomited and cried repeatedly.
An examination showed the child had hypothalamic hamartomas, a non-cancer growth of tissue in the brain. 
Pallister-Hall syndrome is a rare disorder passed down by one of the parents. It ranges from mild to severe.
