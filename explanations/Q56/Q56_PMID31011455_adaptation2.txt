How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disease. It is not known how many people have the disease. It is caused by harmful changes in the genes that are passed down by either parent. The disease is characterized by the presence of a hypothalamic hamartoma (a non-cancer growth in the brain) and extra fingers or toes. 
Other signs include a split in the flap that protects the windpipe, missing or blocked opening to the anus, small nails, reduced function of the pituitary gland, which controls body functions and growth through chemical substances called hormones, dwarfism, and poor development of the reproductive organs.
It is usually recognized in infancy and early childhood by the presence of seizures, signs of the child's body changing to that of an adult too soon, and extra fingers or toes.
Our patient had extra and fused fingers at birth.
Because extra fingers are common and may have different causes, no tests were done.
At the age of 16 he started having headaches and changes in vision. Brain imaging showed a hypothalamic hamartoma, a non-cancer growth in the brain tissues.
He did not have seizures or premature puberty.
Genetic testing showed harmful variants.
Clinicians should think about PHS when they see extra fingers and toes. 
The disease signs in this patient add new knowledge about PHS.
