How common is pallister-hall syndrome?

Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS) is a rare disease passed down from one of the parents. Its signs are six fingers and toes, shortened or split flap that protects the windpipe, problems with the organs in the chest and belly, non-cancer mass in the brain that often causes problems with pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth. 
Signs of PHS in different patients are very different. 
PHS ranges from mild with good outcomes to severe that can lead to death of the newborns. 
We describe a two-year-old girl with deformities of the face, hand and feet and dwarfism.
PHS was diagnosed on the basis of the presented symptoms and genetic tests.
Abnormalities, such as the presence of extra or fewer than five fingers or toes, are associated with disorders of the endocrine system, which includes the glands that regulate body functions through chemicals called hormones.
Quick and correct diagnosis would help in planning treatment for the child and advise the family regarding the next pregnancy of the child's mother.
